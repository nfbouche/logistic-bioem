# Use either Python 2.7 or Python 3.5

Note: it is a good advise to install Python 2.7 or Python 3.5 in virtualenv in order to not interfere with your installation

bash
cd path_to_logistic

virtualenv pyname -p path_to_python
source pyname/bin/activate
pip install ipython  #to install ipython


# install package 
tar xzvf logistic.tar.gz

pip install -r requirements.txt .
