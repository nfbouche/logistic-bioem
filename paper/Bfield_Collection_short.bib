abstract = {Previous studies have suggested an association between exposure to 50-60 Hz magnetic fields (EMF) and childhood leukaemia. We conducted a pooled analysis based on individual records from nine studies, including the most recent ones. Studies with 24/48-hour magnetic field measurements or calculated magnetic fields were included. We specified which data analyses we planned to do and how to do them before we commenced the work. The use of individual records allowed us to use the same exposure definitions, and the large numbers of subjects enabled more precise estimation of risks at high exposure levels. For the 3203 children with leukaemia and 10 338 control children with estimated residential magnetic field exposures levels {\textless} 0.4 microT, we observed risk estimates near the no effect level, while for the 44 children with leukaemia and 62 control children with estimated residential magnetic field exposures {\textgreater}/= 0.4 microT the estimated summary relative risk was 2.00 (1.27-3.13), P value = 0.002). Adjustment for potential confounding variables did not appreciably change the results. For North American subjects whose residences were in the highest wire code category, the estimated summary relative risk was 1.24 (0.82-1.87). Thus, we found no evidence in the combined data for the existence of the so-called wire-code paradox. In summary, the 99.2{\%} of children residing in homes with exposure levels {\textless} 0.4 microT had estimates compatible with no increased risk, while the 0.8{\%} of children with exposures {\textgreater}/= 0.4 microT had a relative risk estimate of approximately 2, which is unlikely to be due to random variability. The explanation for the elevated risk is unknown, but selection bias may have accounted for some of the increase.},

abstract = {Background. We examined the association between extremely low-frequency magnetic fields (EMF) and the risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease using all 9,508 individuals from the Study of Dementia in Swedish Twins (HARMONY) with valid occupational and diagnostic data.
Methods. Dementia diagnoses were based on telephone screening followed by in-person clinical workup. Main lifetime occupation was coded according to an established EMF exposure matrix. Covariates were age, gender, education, vascular risk factors, and complexity of work. Based on previous research, data were also analyzed separately for cases with disease onset by age 75 years versus later, men versus women, and those with manual versus nonmanual main occupation. We used generalized estimating equations with the entire sample (to adjust for the inclusion of complete twin pairs) and conditional logistic regression with complete twin pairs only.
Results. Level of EMF exposure was not significantly associated with dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. However, in stratified analyses, medium and high levels of EMF exposure were associated with increased dementia risk compared with low level in cases with onset by age 75 years (odds ratio: 1.94, 95\% confidence interval: 1.07–3.65 for medium, odds ratio: 2.01, 95\% confidence interval: 1.10–3.65 for high) and in participants with manual occupations (odds ratio: 1.81, 95\% confidence interval: 1.06–3.09 for medium, odds ratio: 1.75, 95\% confidence interval: 1.00–3.05 for high). Results with 42 twin pairs discordant for dementia did not reach statistical significance.
Conclusions. Occupational EMF exposure appears relevant primarily to dementia with an earlier onset and among former manual workers.},

This paper reviews all experiments on human navigation and magnetoreception since 1980 by authors other than myself. These experiments have produced results with a conservative probability of occurring by chance that is less than 0·001 with respect to non-visual orientation and less than 0·005 with respect to magnetoreception. As evidence for the existence of a non-visual ability to orient and navigate based, at least in part, on magnetoreception, the results obtained by other workers now rival those obtained at Manchester. Despite this, other authors continue not to offer support for the view that humans possess magnetoreception ability. This stark contrast between positive results and negative interpretations remains an unexplained feature of the literature on human magnetoreception.},

abstract = {The question whether pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) can affect the Heart Rhythm is still controversial. This study investigates the effects on the cardiocirculatory system of ELF-PEMFs. It is a follow-up to an investigation made of the possible therapeutic effect ELF-PEMFs, using a commercially available magneto therapeutic unit, had on soft tissue injury repair in humans. Modulation of heart rate (HR) or heart rate variability (HRV) can be detected from changes in periodicity of the R-R interval and/or from changes in the numbers of heart-beat/min (bpm), however, R-R interval analysis gives only a quantitative insight into HRV. A qualitative understanding of HRV can be obtained considering the power spectral density (PSD) of the R-R intervals Fourier transform. In this study PSD is the investigative tool used, more specifically the low frequency (LF) PSD and high frequency (HF) PSD ratio (LF/HF) which is an indicator of sympatho-vagal balance. To obtain the PSD value, variations of the R-R time intervals were evaluated from a continuously recorded ECG. The results show a FIR variation in all the subjects when they are exposed to the same ELF-PEMF. This variation can be detected by observing the change in the sympatho-vagal equilibrium, which is an indicator of modulation of heart activity. Variation of the LF/HF PSD ratio mainly occurs at transition times from exposure to nonexposure, or vice versa. Also of interest are the results obtained during the exposure of one subject to a range of different ELF-PEMFs. This pilot study suggests that a full investigation into the effect of ELF-PEMFs on the cardiovascular system is justified.},

abstract = {The etiology of brain tumors remains largely unknown. Among potential risk factors, exposure to electromagnetic fields is suspected. We analyzed the relationship between residential and occupational exposure to electromagnetic field and brain tumors in adults. A case-control study was carried out in southwestern France between May 1999 and April 2001. A total of 221 central nervous system tumors (105 gliomas, 67 meningiomas, 33 neurinomas and 16 others) and 442 individually age- and sex-matched controls selected from general population were included. Electromagnetic field exposure [extremely low frequency (ELF) and radiofrequency separately was assessed in occupational settings through expert judgement based on complete job calendar, and at home by assessing the distance to power lines with the help of a geographical information system. Confounders such as education, use of home pesticide, residency in a rural area and occupational exposure to chemicals were taken into account. Separate analyses were performed for gliomas, meningiomas and acoustic neurinomas. A nonsignificant increase in risk was found for occupational exposure to electromagnetic fields [odds ratio (OR = 1.52, 0.92-2.51)]. This increase became significant for meningiomas, especially when considering ELF separately [OR = 3.02; 95 percent confidence interval (95\% CI) = 1.10-8.25]. The risk of meningioma was also higher in subjects living in the vicinity of power lines (< 100 m), even if not significant (OR = 2.99, 95\% CI 0.86-10.40). These data suggest that occupational or residential exposure to ELF may play a role in the occurrence of meningioma.},

abstract = {The ability to perceive geomagnetic fields (GMFs) represents a fascinating biological phenomenon. Studies on transgenic flies have provided evidence that photosensitive Cryptochromes (Cry) are involved in the response to magnetic fields (MFs). However, none of the studies tackled the problem of whether the Cry-dependent magnetosensitivity is coupled to the sole MF presence or to the direction of MF vector. In this study, we used gene silencing and a directional MF to show that mammalian-like Cry2 is necessary for a genuine directional response to periodic rotations of the GMF vector in two insect species. Longer wavelengths of light required higher photon fluxes for a detectable behavioral response, and a sharp detection border was present in the cyan/green spectral region. Both observations are consistent with involvement of the FADox, FAD(•) (-) and FADH(-) redox forms of flavin. The response was lost upon covering the eyes, demonstrating that the signal is perceived in the eye region. Immunohistochemical staining detected Cry2 in the hemispherical layer of laminal glia cells underneath the retina. Together, these findings identified the eye-localized Cry2 as an indispensable component and a likely photoreceptor of the directional GMF response. Our study is thus a clear step forward in deciphering the In Vivo effects of GMF and supports the interaction of underlying mechanism with the visual system.},

However, Hert and co-authors used a different statistical approach and applied the statistics on a sample partly unsuitable to examine magnetic alignment. About 50\% of their data represent noise (resolution of the images is too poor to enable unambiguous measurement of the direction of body axes, pastures are on slopes, near settlements or high voltage power-lines, etc.). Moreover, the authors have selected for their analysis only similar to 40\% of cattle that were present on the pastures analyzed. Here, we reanalyze all usable data and show that cattle significantly align their body axes in North-South direction on pastures analyzed by Hert and co-authors. This finding thus supports our previous study. In addition, we show by using aerial Google Earth images with good resolution, that the magnetic alignment is more pronounced in resting than in standing cattle.},

abstract = {Magnetic alignment (MA) constitutes the simplest directional response to the geomagnetic field. In contrast to magnetic compass orientation, MA is not goal directed and represents a spontaneous, fixed directional response. Because animals tend to align their bodies along or perpendicular to the magnetic field lines, MA typically leads to bimodal or quadrimodal orientation, although there is also growing evidence for a fixed unimodal orientation not necessarily coinciding with the magnetic cardinal directions. MA has been demonstrated in diverse animals including insects, amphibians, fish, and mammals. Alignment can be expressed by animals during resting as well as on the move (e.g. while grazing, hunting, feeding, etc.). Here, we briefly survey characteristic features and classical examples of MA and review the current knowledge about the occurrence of MA in mammals. In addition, we summarize what is known about mechanisms underlying MA and discuss its prospective biological functions. Finally, we highlight some physiological effects of alignment along the magnetic field axes reported in humans. We argue that the phenomenon of MA adds a new paradigm that can be exploited for investigation of magnetoreception in mammals. (C) 2012 Deutsche Gesellschaft Ilk Saugetierkunde.

abstract = {In order to investigate the influence of various environmental parameters on melatonin excretion, the night-time urinary melatonin excretion of 16 healthy volunteers was measured in samples collected monthly over a period of one year. No significant interindividual differences were detected in the monthly rate of change of melatonin excretion. A seasonal bimodal pattern did, however, emerge. Peak values were observed in June and November. In these months a combination of high daylength stability and low values of the vertical component of the geomagnetic field was recorded. Trough values were found in April and August–October when low daylength stability was combined with high values of the vertical component of the geomagnetic field. We propose that the daylength variation rate, and the fluctuations of the vertical component of the geomagnetic field, interact to induce the changes in melatonin secretion which signalize the different seasons in humans.},

Mean daily exposure of 5.0 microT was maintained for 350 days. Hematological parameters were compared to those of control mice (n=12) exposed to a field level lower than 0.1 microT. Serum biochemical parameters (sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, amylase, creatine phosphokinase, and lactate dehydrogenase) were measured after 28 days of exposure and serum cortisol after 90 and 190 days. Granulocyte/macrophage colony-forming cells (GM-CFC) were counted at the end of the 350-day exposure. On day 20, exposed animals showed a significant decrease in leukocyte, erythrocyte, lymphocyte and monocyte counts and in hemoglobin and hematocrit values, while MCV increased. On days 43 and 63 no significant difference was observed in leukocyte and erythrocyte values, as if hemopoiesis had recovered. On day 90, a significant fall in the leukocyte, polynuclear neutrophil and eosinophil counts was observed in the exposed animals. No significant difference was noted in the biochemical parameters studied. On day 190, exposed animals had neutropenia and a decrease in the cortisol value. On day 350, no significant difference in hematological parameters was noted. Individual differences in sensitivity were observed, as 8 mice in the exposed group showed a significant decrease in the leukocyte, polymorphonuclear neutrophil and GM-CFC counts, while in two mice there was a significant increase in these same values compared to those unexposed mice.},

abstract = {The authors examined immunological disorders in 6 individuals who had been exposed occupationally to environmental electromagnetic fields. Comparable effects on mice exposed in a similar environment were also investigated. The human subjects had worked 8 hr/day for 5 yr in a laboratory located above electrical transformers and high-tension cables, and in which there were low-frequency electromagnetic fields of 0.2-6.6 microtesla (microT). The 6 control subjects (matched for socioeconomic parameters, sex, and age) had worked away from the immediate vicinity of transformers and high-tension cables. The authors found statistically significantly lower total lymphocyte, CD4, and CD3 counts, and significantly increased natural killer (NK) cells, in exposed subjects vs. controls. Six months after exposure had ceased, total lymphocyte counts had increased, as had CD4, CD3, and CD19 counts (+13\%, +28\%, +22\%, and +17\%, respectively), and NK cell counts were decreased by 26\% (not significant) in the same human subjects. In the second part of this study, 12 Swiss male mice housed in cages were exposed in the same room in which the human subjects had been exposed (i.e., 5-microT, 50-Hz magnetic field) for 109 days; 12 additional mice were used as unexposed controls. The total lymphocyte, leukocyte, polymorphonuclear neutrophil, CD4, and NK counts of the exposed mice at 109 days were significantly lower than those of controls. In addition, plasma glucose levels (at 30 days) and amylase activity (at 109 days) were significantly lower, whereas plasma sodium and chloride levels were significantly elevated at 109 days. Results from this study suggest that chronic exposure to a 0.2-6.6-microT magnetic field can lead to decreased immunological parameters (total lymphocytes and CD4 counts) in both humans and mice. The increase in some values once exposure was terminated suggests a causal relationship with exposure to electromagnetic fields, as do the changes in mice, particularly the changes in total lymphocyte and CD4 counts.},

abstract = {A weak association between residential or occupational exposure to electric and magnetic fields (50/60 Hz fields) and an increased incidence of leukemia has been reported. Numerous animal studies have evaluated the potential association between magnetic-field exposure and leukemia. These include long-term (up to 2(1/2) years) bioassays, initiation/promotion studies, investigations in transgenic models, and tumor growth studies. Exposure to 60 Hz circularly polarized magnetic fields at 1,400 microT for 28 months did not affect lymphoma incidence in mice. The study included over 2000 C57BL/6J mice. In another study, 1000 B6C3F(1) mice exposed to 60 Hz magnetic fields up to 1000 microT for 2 years showed no increase in lymphomas. Approximately 400 transgenic Emu-Pim1 mice exposed to 50 Hz fields up to 1000 microT for up to 18 months had no increased incidence of leukemia. Similarly, Trp53(+/-) mice and Pim1transgenic mice exposed to 60 Hz magnetic fields for 23 weeks showed no increased incidence of lymphoma. Three studies in F344 rats exposed to 50 or 60 Hz magnetic fields up to 5 mT showed no increased incidence of leukemia. The combined animal bioassay results are nearly uniformly negative for magnetic-field exposures enhancing leukemia and weaken the possible epidemiological association between magnetic-field exposures and leukemia in humans as suggested by epidemiological data.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The effects of 60-Hz magnetic field and ambient light exposures on the pineal hormone melatonin were studied among electric utility workers. METHODS: Personal exposure was measured at 15-second intervals over 3 consecutive 24-hour periods. Exposure metrics based on magnetic field intensity, intermittence, or temporal stability were calculated for periods of work, home, and sleep. A rate-of-change metric (RCM) was used to estimate intermittence, and the standardized RCM (RCMS = RCM/standard deviation) was used to evaluate temporal stability. The effects of magnetic field exposure on total overnight 6-hydroxymelatonin sulfate (6-OHMS) excretion and creatinine-adjusted nocturnal 6-OHMS (6-OHMS/cr) concentration were analyzed with adjustment for age, month, and light exposure. RESULTS: Magnetic field intensity, intermittence, or cumulative exposure had little influence on nocturnal 6-OHMS excretion. Residential RCMS magnetic field exposures were associated with lower nocturnal 6-OHMS/cr concentrations. In multivariate statistical analyses, the interaction term for geometric mean and RCMS magnetic field exposures at home was associated with lower nocturnal 6-OHMS/cr and overnight 6-OHMS levels. Modest reductions in the mean 6-OHMS levels occurred after RCMS exposures during work. The greatest reductions occurred when RCMS exposures both at work and at home were combined; therefore the effects of temporally stable magnetic fields may be integrated over a large portion of the day. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study provide evidence that temporally stable magnetic field exposures are associated with reduced nocturnal 6-OHMS excretion in humans.},

Melatonin was assessed by radioimmunoassay of its metabolite, 6-hydroxymelatonin sulfate (6-OHMS), in post-work shift urine samples. Personal magnetic field and light exposures were measured over 3 consecutive days using EMDEX C meters adapted with light sensors. Two independent components of magnetic field exposure, intensity (geometric time weighted average) and temporal stability (standardized rate of change metric or RCMS), were analyzed for their effects on creatinine-adjusted 6-OHMS concentrations (6-OHMS/cr) after adjustment for age, month, and light exposure. Geometric mean magnetic field exposures were not associated with 6-OHMS/cr excretion. Men in the highest quartile of temporally stable magnetic field exposure had lower 6-OHMS/cr concentrations on the second and third days compared with those in the lowest quartile. Light exposure modified the magnetic field effect. A progressive decrease in mean 6-OHMS/cr concentrations in response to temporally stable magnetic fields was observed in subjects with low workplace light exposures (predominantly office workers), whereas those with high ambient light exposure showed negligible magnetic field effects. Melatonin suppression may be useful for understanding human biologic responses to magnetic field exposures.},

abstract = {Reports dealing with the stimulus-response relationship between low-level, low frequency electromagnetic fields (EMFs) and changes in brain electrical activity permit assessment of the hypothesis that EMFs are detected by the body via the process of sensory transduction. These reports, as well as those involving effects on brain activity observed after a fixed time of exposure, are critically reviewed here. A consistent stimulus-response relationship between EMFs and changes in brain activity has been demonstrated in animal and human subjects. The effects, which consisted of onset and offset evoked potentials, were observed under conditions permitting the inference that the fields were transduced like ordinary stimuli such as light and sound. However, unlike the changes in brain activity induced by these stimuli, the changes induced by EMFs were governed by nonlinear laws. The studies involving attempts to determine whether a period of EMF exposure caused a metabolic effect reflected in pre-exposure/post-exposure differences in brain activity were generally inconclusive.},

The mechanism/s involved in such effects are not known. It has been hypothesized that the magnetic fields (MF) could act on the pineal gland directly and/or indirectly through the retina. The aim of this work was to study whether MFs could modify NAT activity through a direct effect on the gland. Pineal glands obtained from rats sacrificed in the middle of the dark period were exposed during a 1-h incubation to 10-, 100-, or 1,000-muT, 50-Hz, sinusoidal MFs. The results showed that the glands exposed to the highest magnetic flux density responded with a significant decrease in NAT activity. The data obtained from these experiments support the idea that the pineal gland can be directly affected by ELF electromagnetic fields.},

@article{Close2012,
abstract = {A controversial body of literature demonstrates associations of geomagnetic storms (GMS) with numerous cardiovascular, psychiatric and behavioural outcomes. Various melatonin hypotheses of GMS have suggested that temporal variation in the geomagnetic field (GMF) may be acting as an additional zeitgeber (a temporal synchronizer) for circadian rhythms, with GMS somehow interfering with the hypothesized system. The cryptochrome genes are known primarily as key components of the circadian pacemaker, ultimately involved in controlling the expression of the hormone melatonin. Cryptochrome is identified as a clear candidate for mediating the effect of GMS on humans, demonstrating the prior existence of several crucial pieces of evidence. A distinct scientific literature demonstrates the widespread use of geomagnetic information for navigation across a range of taxa. One mechanism of magnetoreception is thought to involve a light-dependent retinal molecular system mediated by cryptochrome, acting in a distinct functionality to its established role as a circadian oscillator. There is evidence suggesting that such a magnetosense—or at least the vestiges of it—may exist in humans. This paper argues that cryptochrome is not acting as secondary geomagnetic zeitgeber to influence melatonin synthesis. Instead, it is hypothesized that the cryptochrome compass system is mediating stress responses more broadly across the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis (including alterations to circadian behaviour) in response to changes in the GMF. Two conceptual models are outlined for the existence of such responses—the first as a generalized migrational/dispersal strategy, the second as a stress response to unexpected signals to the magnetosense. It is therefore proposed that GMS lead to disorientation of hormonal systems in animals and humans, thus explaining the effects of GMS on human health and behaviour.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES. Exposure to extremely low frequency electromagnetic fi elds (ELF- EMF) has been suggested to suppress melatonin secretion, which might result in higher cancer risks because of its missing oncostatic action. We investigated the eff ects of residential exposure to ELF-EMF on the excretion of urinary 6-sulfatox- ymelatonin (6-OHMS), the major melatonin metabolite, as an indicator of noc- turnal melatonin secretion. METHODS. 6-OHMS was measured in two spot urine samples, collected at 22.00 h and 08.00 h, in 29 men and 22 women. Spot ELF-EMF measurements were con- ducted at the centre and the four angles of the living room, the bedroom, and the kitchen of study subjects at low current confi guration (all lights and appliances turned off ), and they were repeated immediately at high current confi guration (all lights and appliances turned on). RESULTS. Risk of a reduced 6-OMHS nocturnal secretion was elevated for daily alcohol intake (OR = 6.4; 95{\%}C.I. 1.4,33.1), and body mass index (BMI) above the median (OR = 2.2; 95{\%}C.I. 0.5,9.6). Risk of disrupted rhythm of 6-OHMS excre- tion was moderately elevated for domestic ELF-EMF exposure above the upper tertile at low current confi guration (OR = 2.6; 95{\%}C.I. 0.4,15.7). CONCLUSION. Alcohol consumption, BMI, and gender seem to aff ect nocturnal melatonin secretion, while an eff ect of residential exposure to ELF-EMF is uncertain. Future studies should properly account for the eff ect of such variables, when addressing the hypothesis of disturbances in melatonin secretion as a plausible explanation for the reported excess risk of several tumOral Dis. associated with low level ELF-EMF exposure.},

abstract = {Thirty years ago, Nancy Wertheimer and Ed Leeper published the first report on the association between childhood cancer and "electrical current configuration" of houses in Denver, Colorado. In 2001 the International Agency for Research on Cancer defined 50-60 Hz magnetic fields as "possibly carcinogenic to humans" because of the "limited evidence" of carcinogenicity of residential exposure relatively to childhood leukemia. With respect to health effects other than cancer, namely neurodegenerative disorders, miscarriage, subtle differences in the timing of melatonin release, altered autonomic control of the heart, and changes in the number of natural killer cells, some open questions still remain. Several authors recommended further investigation of the possible long-term effects of magnetic fields, focussing on populations experiencing high exposure levels. In this frame a research team of ISS searched for a suitable location to implement an epidemiological study aimed at a wide range of outcomes for which a priori hypotheses could be formulated. The recently published findings of this project showed an increase of primary and secondary malignant neoplasms, ischaemic disease and haematological diseases. Future studies should thus address the most exposed sectors of the population, take into account different outcomes (all neoplasms, neurodegenerative diseases, immunological disorders, specific cardiovascular effects) and follow research protocols that enable subsequent pooled analyses. A precautionary approach may provide the frame for decision making where the available resources for environmental remediation be prioritatively allocated to worst-off situations.},

As people are continuously exposed to EMFs in everyday life, it is a matter of great debate whether they can be harmful to human health. On the basis of two decades of epidemiological studies, an increased risk for childhood leukemia associated with Extremely Low Frequency fields has been consistently assessed, inducing the International Agency for Research on Cancer to insert them in the 2B section of carcinogens in 2001. EMFs interaction with biological systems may cause oxidative stress under certain circumstances. Since free radicals are essential for brain physiological processes and pathological degeneration, research focusing on the possible influence of the EMFs-driven oxidative stress is still in progress, especially in the light of recent studies suggesting that EMFs may contribute to the etiology of neurodegenerative disorders. This review synthesizes the emerging evidences about this topic, highlighting the wide data uncertainty that still characterizes the EMFs effect on oxidative stress modulation, as both pro-oxidant and neuroprotective effects have been documented. Care should be taken to avoid methodological limitations and to determine the patho-physiological relevance of any alteration found in EMFs-exposed biological system.},

abstract = {Concern about the health effects of extremely low frequency (ELF) magnetic fields (MF) has been raised by epidemiological studies indicating an association between certain cancers and living near power lines or working in high electric field environments. Alterations in pineal function have been proposed as a mechanism through which power-frequency MFs may interact with living organisms. A double blind laboratory study was performed to evaluate daytime exposure effects of 100 muT root mean square (rms) 50 Hz MF. Three head exposure sessions of 30 min each were performed: sham, continuous, and intermittent (15 s on/off cycles) MFs were presented to each subject in early or late afternoon (13:30 or 16:30 hr). Twenty-one healthy male volunteers (20-27 yr old) participated in these 3-weekly experimental conditions. Blood samples were drawn for serum melatonin measurement, hourly at night (from 20:00 to 07:00 hr) under controlled environmental conditions. Urinary excretion of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6s), the main melatonin metabolite, was measured for a 17 hr period, by means of urine samples taken at 19:00 hr (14:00-19:00 hr "afternoon period"), 23:00 hr (19:00-23:00 hr "evening period"), and 07:00 hr, day 2 (23:00-07:00 hr day 2 "night-time period"). There were no significant differences in either plasma melatonin or in aMT6s excretion profiles in the three experimental conditions. However, a tendency for a smaller increase of night-time urinary aMT6s after continuous MF exposure was found (P = 0.08) particularly in men with the lower excretion rate of aMT6s ("Low Group") (P = 0.07). We conclude that this study does not indicate that daytime acute MF exposure influences either melatonin secretion or aMT6s excretion. Inter-individual differences in pineal production of melatonin, however, have to be taken into account in further studies.},

Progression through the cycle was monitored by examining the timing of entry into S phase, as characterised by the onset of DNA synthesis. Simultaneous positive controls were exposed to human recombinant fibroblast growth factor to demonstrate that the system was responsive to external stimuli. Exposure to magnetic fields at 20 and 200 $\mu$T induced a small but significant increase in the length of the G1 phase of the Cell Cycle.

abstract = {Aims
This report is the first study of the possible relationship between extremely low frequency (50–60 Hz, ELF) magnetic field (MF) exposure and severe cognitive dysfunction. Earlier studies investigated the relationships between MF occupational exposure and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or dementia. These studies had mixed results, depending upon whether the diagnosis of AD or dementia was performed by experts and upon the methodology used to classify MF exposure.

Study Design
Population-based case-control.

Place and Duration of Study
Neurology and Prev. Med., Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, 2 years.

Methodology
The study population consisted of 3050 Mexican Americans, aged 65+, enrolled in Phase 1 of the Hispanic Established Population for the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly (H-EPESE) study. Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) results, primary occupational history, and other data were collected. Severe cognitive dysfunction was defined as an MMSE score below 10. The MF exposure methodology developed and used in earlier studies was used.

Results
Univariate odds ratios (OR) were 3.4 (P< .03; 95\% CI: 1.3–8.9) for high and 1.7 (P=.27; 95\% CI: 0.7–4.1) for medium or high (M/H) MF occupations. In multivariate main effects models, the results were similar. When interaction terms were allowed in the models, the interactions between M/H or high occupational MF exposure and smoking history or age group were statistically significant, depending upon whether two (65–74, 75+) or three (65–74, 75–84, 85+) age groups were considered, respectively. When the analyses were limited to subjects aged 75+, the interactions between M/H or high MF occupations and a positive smoking history were statistically significant.

Conclusion
The results of this study indicate that working in an occupation with high or M/H MF exposure may increase the risk of severe cognitive dysfunction. Smoking and older age may increase the deleterious effect of MF exposure.},

abstract = {Purpose: Exposure to residential magnetic fields may disrupt the normal nocturnal rise in melatonin levels, resulting in increased risk for breast cancer, possibly through increased levels of reproductive hormones. We investigated whether exposure to a 60-Hz magnetic field under controlled conditions is associated with a decrease in urinary nocturnal 6-sulfatoxymelatonin level and increase in luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and estrogen levels in healthy premenopausal women. Methods: Using a crossover design, half the participants were assigned to magnetic field exposure of 5 to 10 mG greater than ambient levels for 5 consecutive nights during the early to midluteal phase of the menstrual cycle. On the last night of exposure, a nocturnal urine sample was collected. The next month, participants were sham exposed. The other half of participants were assigned the reverse order of exposure. Results: Magnetic field exposure was associated with decreased 6-sulfatoxymelatonin levels, but no changes in reproductive hormone levels were observed. Participants using prescription medications and anovulatory participants had more pronounced decreases in 6-sulfatoxymelatonin levels with magnetic field exposure. Conclusion: This study provides further evidence that exposure to magnetic fields is associated with decreased nocturnal melatonin levels, but does not support the hypothesis that such exposure results in increased urinary levels of estrogens, LH, or FSH. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Background
A large number of studies explored the biological effects of extremely low-frequency (0–300 Hz) magnetic fields (ELF-MFs) on nervous system both at cellular and at system level in the intact human brain reporting several functional changes. However, the results of different studies are quite variable and the mechanisms of action of ELF-MFs are still poorly defined. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the effects of ELF-MFs on nervous system.
Methods
We convened a workgroup of researchers in the field to review and discuss the available data about the nervous system effects produced by the exposure to ELF-MFs.
Main Findings/Discussion
We reviewed several methodological, experimental and clinical studies and discussed the findings in five sections. The first section analyses the devices used for ELF-MF exposure. The second section reviews the contribution of the computational methods and models for investigating the interaction between ELF-MFs and neuronal systems. The third section analyses the experimental data at cellular and tissue level showing the effects on cell membrane receptors and intracellular signaling and their correlation with neural stem Cell Prolif. and differentiation. The fourth section reviews the studies performed in the intact human brain evaluating the changes produced by ELF-MFs using neurophysiological and neuroPsychol. Methods. The last section shows the limits and shortcomings of the available data, evidences the key challenges in the field and tracks directions for future research.},

abstract = {Objective To determine whether there is an association between distance of home address at birth from high voltage power lines and the incidence of leukaemia and other cancers in children in England and Wales. Design Case-control study. Setting Cancer registry and National Grid records. Subjects Records of 29 081 children with cancer, including 9700 with leukaemia. Children were aged 0-14 years and born in England and Wales, 1962-95. Controls were individually matched for sex, approximate date of birth, and birth registration district. No active participation was required. Main outcome measures Distance from home address at birth to the nearest high voltage overhead power line in existence at the time. Results Compared with those who lived {\textgreater} 600 m from a line at birth, children who lived within 200 m had a relative risk of leukaemia of 1.69 (95{\%} confidence interval 1.13 to 2.53); those born between 200 and 600 m had a relative risk of 1.23 (1.02 to 1.49). There was a significant (P {\textless} 0.01) trend in risk in relation to the reciprocal of distance from the line. No excess risk in relation to proximity to lines was found for other childhood cancers. Conclusions There is an association between childhood leukaemia and proximity of home address at birth to high voltage power lines, and the apparent risk extends to a greater distance than would have been expected from previous studies. About 4{\%} of children in England and Wales live within 600 m of high voltage lines at birth. If the association is causal, about 1{\%} of childhood leukaemia in England and Wales would be attributable to these lines, though this estimate has considerable statistical uncertainty. There is no accepted biological mechanism to explain the epidemiological results; indeed, the relation may be due to chance or confounding.},

abstract = {Background: Extremely low-frequency magnetic fields are designated as possibly carcinogenic in humans, based on an epidemiologic association with childhood leukemia. Evidence for associations with adult cancers is weaker and inconsistent. Methods: We conducted a case-control study to investigate risks of adult cancers in relation to distance and extremely low-frequency magnetic fields from high-voltage overhead power lines using National Cancer Registry Data in England and Wales, 1974-2008. The study included 7823 leukemia, 6781 brain/central nervous system cancers, 9153 malignant melanoma, 29,202 female breast cancer cases, and 79,507 controls frequency-matched on year and region (three controls per case except for female breast cancer, one control per case) 15-74 years of age living within 1000 m of a high-voltage overhead power line. Results: There were no clear patterns of excess risk with distance from power lines. After adjustment for confounders (age, sex [except breast cancer], deprivation, rurality), for distances closest to the power lines (0-49 m) compared with distances 600-1000 m, odds ratios (ORs) ranged from 0.82 (95\% confidence interval = 0.61-1.11; 66 cases) for malignant melanoma to 1.22 (0.88-1.69) for brain/central nervous system cancer. We observed no meaningful excess risks and no trends of risk with magnetic field strength for the four cancers examined. In adjusted analyses at the highest estimated field strength, >= 1000 nanotesla (nT), compared with <100 nT, ORs ranged from 0.68 (0.39-1.17) for malignant melanoma to 1.08 (0.77-1.51) for female breast cancer. Conclusion: Our results do not support an epidemiologic association of adult cancers with residential magnetic fields in proximity to high-voltage overhead power lines.

abstract = {Electromagnetic noise is emitted everywhere humans use electronic devices. For decades, it has been hotly debated whether man-made electric and magnetic fields affect biological processes, including human health. So far, no putative effect of anthropogenic electromagnetic noise at intensities below the guidelines adopted by the World Health Organization has withstood the test of independent replication under truly blinded experimental conditions. No effect has therefore been widely accepted as scientifically proven. Here we show that migratory birds are unable to use their magnetic compass in the presence of urban electromagnetic noise. When European robins, Erithacus rubecula, were exposed to the background electromagnetic noise present in unscreened wooden huts at the University of Oldenburg campus, they could not orient using their magnetic compass. Their magnetic orientation capabilities reappeared in electrically grounded, aluminium-screened huts, which attenuated electromagnetic noise in the frequency range from 50 kHz to 5 MHz by approximately two orders of magnitude. When the grounding was removed or when broadband electromagnetic noise was deliberately generated inside the screened and grounded huts, the birds again lost their magnetic orientation capabilities. The disruptive effect of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields is not confined to a narrow frequency band and birds tested far from sources of electromagnetic noise required no screening to orient with their magnetic compass. These fully double-blinded tests document a reproducible effect of anthropogenic electromagnetic noise on the behaviour of an intact vertebrate.},

abstract = {The blue-light sensitive photoreceptor cryptochrome (CRY) may act as a magneto-receptor through formation of radical pairs involving a triad of tryptophans. Previous genetic analyses of behavioral responses of Drosophila to electromagnetic fields using conditioning, circadian and geotaxis assays have lent some support to the radical pair model (RPM). Here, we describe a new method that generates consistent and reliable circadian responses to electromagnetic fields that differ substantially from those already reported. We used the Schuderer apparatus to isolate Drosophila from local environmental variables, and observe extremely low frequency (3 to 50 Hz) field-induced changes in two locomotor phenotypes, circadian period and activity levels. These field-induced phenotypes are CRY- and blue-light dependent, and are correlated with enhanced CRY stability. Mutational analysis of the terminal tryptophan of the triad hypothesised to be indispensable to the electron transfer required by the RPM reveals that this residue is not necessary for field responses. We observe that deletion of the CRY C-terminus dramatically attenuates the EMF-induced period changes, whereas the N-terminus underlies the hyperactivity. Most strikingly, an isolated CRY C-terminus that does not encode the Tryptophan triad nor the FAD binding domain is nevertheless able to mediate a modest EMF-induced period change. Finally, we observe that hCRY2, but not hCRY1, transformants can detect EMFs, suggesting that hCRY2 is blue light-responsive. In contrast, when we examined circadian molecular cycles in wild-type mouse suprachiasmatic nuclei slices under blue light, there was no field effect. Our results are therefore not consistent with the classical Trp triad-mediated RPM and suggest that CRYs act as blue-light/EMF sensors depending on trans-acting factors that are present in particular cellular environments.},

The study base consisted of everyone under age 16 years who had lived on a property located within 300 meters of any of the 220 and 400 kV power lines in Sweden during the period 1960-1985. Subjects were followed from their entry into the study base through 1985. A total of 142 cancer cases were identified through a record linkage to the Swedish Cancer Registry. There were 39 leukemia and 33 central nervous system tumor cases. A total of 558 controls were selected at random from the study base. Exposure was assessed by spot measurements and by calculations of the magnetic fields generated by the power lines, taking distance, line configuration, and load into account. Information about historical loads on the power lines was used to calculate the magnetic fields for the year closest in time to diagnosis. When historical calculations were used as exposure assessment for childhood leukemia with cutoff points at 0.1 and 0.2 microtesla (microT), the estimated relative risk increased over the two exposure levels and was estimated at 2.7 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.0-6.3) for 0.2 microT and over; p for trend = 0.02. When the upper cutoff point was shifted to 0.3 microT, the relative risk was 3.8 (95\% CI 1.4-9.3); p for trend = 0.005. These results persisted when adjustment for potential confounding factors was made.

Methods: We conducted a cohort study to explore these associations. We studied all economically active individuals in the Swedish 1980 census (4,812,646 subjects), and followed them for neurodegenerative disease mortality from 1981 through 1995. Information about occupation was available for 1970 and 1980. A job-exposure matrix based on magnetic field measurements was used to assess EMF exposure. Results: An increased risk of Alzheimer's disease mortality was observed among men exposed both in 1970 and 1980 (relative risk = 2.3; 95\% confidence interval = 1.6-3.3 for exposure greater than or equal to0.5 muT). The associations were most pronounced for early-onset Alzheimer's disease mortality or with follow-up limited to 10 years after the last known occupation. Amyotroph. Lateral Scler. was not associated with EMF exposure, but the risk estimate with "electrical and electronics work" was 1.4 (95\% confidence interval = 1.1-1.9). Conclusions: Our study gives some support to the hypothesis that EMF exposure increases the risk of early-onset Alzheimer's disease, and suggests that magnetic field exposure may represent a late-acting influence in the disease process.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Based on 1,596,959 men and 806,278 women, site-specific cancer incidence during 1971 through 1984 was analyzed in relation to occupational magnetic field exposure. The objective was to explore potential associations for cancer diseases beyond those extensively studied before (leukemia and brain tumors).

METHODS: Exposure was assessed from Census information on occupations that were linked to a job exposure matrix based on measurements. In a basic analysis, three levels of exposure were used. In addition, subjects with a more definite low exposure were compared with an aggregate of occupations with more definite exposures.

RESULTS: Observed associations were weak and there were no evident exposure-response relationships. For all cancer, an approximate 10\% increase in risk was seen in the medium and high exposure groups. Several types of cancer were associated with exposure among men, including cancer of the colon, biliary passages and liver, larynx and lung, testis, kidney, urinary organs, malignant melanoma, non-melanoma skin cancer, astrocytoma III-IV. For women, associations were seen for cancer of the lung, breast, corpus uteri, malignant melanoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

CONCLUSIONS: In the analysis of occupations with a more definite exposure, the most notable finding for men was an increased risk of testicular cancer in young workers, and for women a clear association emerged for cancer of the corpus uteri. The outcome suggests an interaction with the endocrine/immune system.},

Here we show using a transgenic approach that human CRY2, which is heavily expressed in the retina, can function as a magnetosensor in the magnetoreception system of Drosophila and that it does so in a light-dependent manner. The results show that human CRY2 has the molecular capability to function as a light-sensitive magnetosensor and reopen an area of sensory biology that is ready for further exploration in humans., In animals, cryptochrome proteins are thought to be the detectors of the Earth's magnetic field, but humans have not been shown to posess mangetosensing capabilities.

abstract = {Although many animals use the Earth's magnetic field for orientation and navigation, the precise biophysical mechanisms underlying magnetic sensing have been elusive. One theoretical model proposes that geomagnetic fields are perceived by chemical reactions involving specialized photoreceptors. However, the specific photoreceptor involved in such magnetoreception has not been demonstrated conclusively in any animal. Here we show that the ultraviolet-A/blue-light photoreceptor cryptochrome (Cry) is necessary for light-dependent magnetosensitive responses in Drosophila melanogaster. In a binary-choice behavioural assay for magnetosensitivity, wild-type flies show significant naive and trained responses to a magnetic field under full-spectrum light ({\~{}}300–700 nm) but do not respond to the field when wavelengths in the Cry-sensitive, ultraviolet-A/blue-light part of the spectrum ({\textless}420 nm) are blocked. Notably, Cry-deficient cry0 and cryb flies do not show either naive or trained responses to a magnetic field under full-spectrum light. Moreover, Cry-dependent magnetosensitivity does not require a functioning circadian clock. Our work provides, to our knowledge, the first genetic evidence for a Cry-based magnetosensitive system in any animal.},

abstract = {Objectives: Diurnal cortisol secretion levels were measured and circadian cortisol profiles were evaluated in a pilot study conducted to test the hypothesis that grounding the human body to earth* during sleep will result in quantifiable changes in cortisol. It was also hypothesized that grounding the human body would result in changes in sleep, pain, and stress (anxiety, depression, irritability), as measured by subjective reporting. Subjects and Interventions: Twelve (12) subjects with complaints of sleep dysfunction, pain, and stress were grounded to earth during sleep for 8 weeks in their own beds using a conductive mattress pad. Saliva tests were administered to establish pregrounding baseline cortisol levels. Levels were obtained at 4-hour intervals for a 24-hour period to determine the circadian cortisol profile. Cortisol testing was repeated at week 6. Subjective symptoms of sleep dysfunction, pain, and stress were reported daily throughout the 8-week test period. Results: Measurable improvements in diurnal cortisol profiles were observed, with cortisol levels significantly reduced during night-time sleep. Subjects' 24-hour circadian cortisol profiles showed a trend toward normalization. Subjectively reported symptoms, including sleep dysfunction, pain, and stress, were reduced or eliminated in nearly all subjects. Conclusions: Results indicate that grounding the human body to earth ("earthing") during sleep reduces night-time levels of cortisol and resynchronizes cortisol hormone secretion more in alignment with the natural 24-hour circadian rhythm profile. Changes were most apparent in females. Furthermore, subjective reporting indicates that grounding the human body to earth during sleep improves sleep and reduces pain and stress.},

abstract = {In a preliminary study a reduction in natural killer (NK) cell activity in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) was observed in a group of workers exposed to levels of extremely low frequency-magnetic fields (ELF-MF) exceeding 1 microT. This study was performed to confirm the results. In 121 workers engaged in various occupational activities, individual ELF-MF exposure was monitored for 2 work shifts. Exposure levels were calculated as time-weighted average (TWA). Subjects were classified as Low exposure (TWA < or = 0.2 microT), Medium exposure (TWA 0.21-0.99 microT), or Higher exposure (TWA > or = 1 microT). In higher exposure workers NK activity proved significantly reduced compared to low exposure,(p<0.01). In medium exposure a reduction was also observed, but the difference was not significant. Multivariate analysis also confirmed the relation between exposure and NK activity. It has been suggested that ELF might affect tumour progression by inducing changes in the immune system: due to the role played by NK activity in host defence against cancer, the interference with the NK cell activity observed in this study is in agreement with this hypothesis. Furthermore, an increased risk for some neurodegenerative disorders has been reported in some epidemiological studies in ELF-MF-exposed workers: changes in NK function were also described in these diseases. Our results, showing the effect on NK activity of exposure exceeding 1 microT, suggest a possible mechanism for ELF-MF effects. This could open New Horiz. regarding the adverse long-term effects of these fields.},

abstract = {Extremely Low Frequency-Magnetic Fields (ELF-MF) are possible carcinogens to humans and some data suggest that they can act as promoters or progressors. Since NK cells play a major role in the control of cancer development, an adverse effect on ELF-MF on NK function has been hypothesized. We examined NK activity in 52 workers exposed to different levels of ELF-MF in various activities. Individual exposure was monitored during 3 complete work-shifts using personal dosimeters. Environmental exposure was also monitored. ELF-MF levels in the workers were expressed as Time-Weighted Average (TWA) values. NK activity was measured in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). In the whole group the median occupational TWA was 0.21 microT. According to the TWA levels, workers were classified as low exposed (26 subjects, TWA < or =0.2 microT) and higher exposed workers (26 subjects; TWA >0.2 microT). In higher exposed workers, we observed a trend to reduce NK activity compared to low exposed, but the difference was not significant. Then we selected a subgroup of highest exposed workers (12 subjects; TWA >1 microT); no difference was observed between low and highest exposed subjects in the main personal variables. Considering both E:T ratios from 12:1 to 50:1 and Lytic Units, a significant reduction in NK activity was observed in the highest exposed workers compared to the low exposed. Multivariate analysis showed a significant negative correlation between exposure and LU, while no correlation was evidenced with other personal characteristics. ELF-MF are considered possible carcinogens, and existing data suggest that they can act as promoters. Due to the role of NK activity in host defence against cancer, the results obtained in this study in workers exposed to ELF-MF levels exceeding 1 microT are in agreement with this hypothesis, and support the need for further investigation in this field.},

abstract = {Summary
Few subjects in animal behavior have more exotic mystery than magnetic-field sensitivity. A force we cannot sense, generated by events no one completely understands, creates field lines that pass through our bodies without any evident effect on us or on them. It is an energy felt as much by migrating lobsters on the sea floor as by ocean-crossing birds thousands of meters overhead, transduced in generally poorly understood ways. Despite the blindness of humans, modern life depends on this invisible, ghostlike field. Aside from lights and heaters, nearly every electrical device we own makes use of electromagnetism, and that same magnetism is essential in generating the power these new-found necessities consume. But for many animals, the reliance is far older and more basic: their life-or-death ability to find their way around in the world depends on correctly interpreting the earth's magnetic field.},

@article{Graham1996,
abstract = {Two double-blind laboratory-based studies were performed to determine whether a suppression of nocturnal melatonin similar to that observed in rodents occurs when humans are exposed to magnetic fields at night. In study 1, 33 men were exposed to sham, 10 mG, or 200 mG intermittent, circularly polarized magnetic fields from 2300 to 0700 h under controlled environmental and exposure test conditions. Overall, exposure had no effect on melatonin levels. Men with preexisting low levels of melatonin, however, showed significantly greater suppression of melatonin when they were exposed to light and also when they were exposed to the 200 mG magnetic-field condition. Study 2 directly tested the hypothesis that low-melatonin subjects show enhanced sensitivity when exposed to light and to 200 mG magnetic fields. After preexposure screening, each of 40 men slept in the exposure facility on two nights. On one night, the men were sham exposed. On the other night, they were exposed to the 200 mG field condition used previously. Again, exposure had no overall effect on melatonin levels. The original finding of enhanced sensitivity in low-melatonin subjects was not replicated in this study. We conclude that the intermittent exposure conditions used in these two studies were not effective in altering nocturnal melatonin release patterns in human volunteers. Further research is underway with regard to exposure parameters, hormonal and immune system measures, and individual differences. (C) 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Magnetic field-induced suppression of nocturnal melatonin in humans has been reported in occupational and residential studies, but not in laboratory-based exposure studies. The present study examined whether this contrasting pattern of results might be related to associated differences in exposure duration or to field-induced measurement instability over time. Thirty healthy young men were evaluated using a randomized, double-blind test protocol. Statistical analysis indicated that 4 consecutive nights of exposure to power-frequency magnetic fields at occupational intensity (resultant flux density = 28.3 microtesla, muT, [283 milligauss, mG]) had no differential effect on concentrations of melatonin or its major enzymatic metabolite (6-hydroxymelatonin sulfate, 6-OHMS) in daily morning urine samples, compared to equivalent no-exposure sham control conditions. The consistency of intra-individual urinary measurements over the 4 test nights also was quite high (P < 0.01) in the sham control condition. In contrast, repeated nightly exposure to the magnetic field was associated with reduced consistency. Morning urinary measures obtained after exposure on night 4 differed (P < 0.01) from similar measures obtained after the second and third exposure night. Thus, while the overall results of this study do not support the melatonin hypothesis, there is some suggestion of a possible cumulative effect of magnetic field exposure on the stability of individual melatonin measurements over time. Additional research with longer periods of controlled exposure may be warranted.},

abstract = {Objectives: The present experiments concerned the hypothesis that an intermittent, strong and extremely low frequency magnetic field reduces salivary melatonin levels and delays consecutively the nadirs of rectal temperature and heart rate. Methods: Twelve healthy young men (18-25 years) participated in three randomly permuted sessions, which were performed as constant routines. The participants kept a strict bed rest over 26 h, air temperature was 20 degreesC, illumination {\textless} 30 lx, and sound level {\textless} 50 dBA. Salivary melatonin levels were determined hourly, rectal temperature and heart rate were registered continuously throughout. An intermittent magnetic field was administered in one session from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. at 16.7 Hz, 0.2 mT and alternating on/off-periods of 15 s. This situation was compared with a control session without any additional stress. Another session was performed to determine the participants' ability to respond to a well-known melatonin- suppressing stress, namely bright light (1,500 lx, 10 p.m.-2 a.m.). Results: Bright light inhibited melatonin synthesis in all 12 participants and delayed the nadirs of rectal temperature and heart rate. The only significant alteration that was associated with exposure to the magnetic field was a delay in the heart rate nadir which was not mediated by an accordingly altered melatonin profile. Conclusion: The fact that the circadian rhythm of only the heart rate was altered indicates an internal dissociation which might constitute a health risk in the long run and needs to be investigated more extensively.},

abstract = {Recent studies on the association between exposure to 50- to 60-Hz fields and cancer carried out among electric utility workers have focused mainly on the magnetic field component of exposure. The authors have investigated tumor risks specifically associated with electric fields, as this exposure is distinct from magnetic fields. The study design is a case-control study nested within a cohort of 170,000 workers employed at Electricit\'{e} de France-Gaz de France (EDF) between 1978 and 1989. All incident cases of cancer and benign tumor of the brain diagnosed in 1978-1989 among workers before the age of retirement were included. Four randomly selected controls were individually matched to each case by year of birth. The exposure to electric fields was assessed from measurements collected in 850 EDF workers for a full work week. Arithmetic and geometric mean exposures were included in a job-exposure matrix to determine the cumulative exposure of the cases and the controls. Exposures to potentially carcinogenic chemicals found at the workplace were also evaluated through expert judgment. The analysis by site of tumor did not show any increased risk for leukemia (72 cases). An odds ratio of 3.08 (95\% confidence interval 1.08-8.74) was observed for all brain tumors (69 cases) for exposure above the 90th percentile (> or = 387 V/m-year), and there was some indication of a dose-response relation, although the risk did not increase monotonically with exposure. No confounding from magnetic fields or from other potentially carcinogenic hazards was apparent. The observed association was somewhat stronger after allowing a 5-year latency period before diagnosis (odds ratio = 3.69, 95\% confidence interval 1.10-12.43) for exposure above the 90th percentile. However, the risk of brain tumor could not be linked to a specific type of tumor. An unexpected association was also observed for colon cancer, using geometric indexes of exposure, but no other association was seen for any other type of cancer. Our study indicates that electric fields may have a specific effect on the risk of brain tumor, and that this should be taken into account in future analyses on the carcinogenic effects of 50- to 60-Hz fields.},

abstract = {Convincing evidence that migrant monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) use a magnetic compass to aid their fall migration has been lacking from the spectacular navigational capabilities of this species. Here we use flight simulator studies to show that migrants indeed possess an inclination magnetic compass to help direct their flight equatorward in the fall. The use of this inclination compass is light-dependent utilizing ultraviolet-A/blue light between 380 and 420 nm. Notably, the significance of light <420 nm for inclination compass function was not considered in previous monarch studies. The antennae are important for the inclination compass because they appear to contain light-sensitive magnetosensors. For migratory monarchs, the inclination compass may serve as an important orientation mechanism when directional daylight cues are unavailable and may also augment time-compensated sun compass orientation for appropriate directionality throughout the migration.},

abstract = {During recent years there has been increasing public concern on potential health risks from power-frequency fields (extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields; ELF) and from radiofrequency/microwave radiation emissions (RF) from wireless communications. Non-thermal (low-intensity) biological effects have not been considered for regulation of microwave exposure, although numerous Sci. Rep. indicate such effects. The BioInitiative Report is based on an international research and Public Policy initiative to give an overview of what is known of biological effects that occur at low-intensity electromagnetic fields (EMFs) exposure. Health endpoints reported to be associated with ELF and/or RF include childhood leukaemia, brain tumours, genotoxic effects, neurological effects and neurodegenerative diseases, immune system deregulation, allergic and inflammatory responses, breast cancer, miscarriage and some cardiovascular effects. The BioInitiative Report concluded that a reasonable suspicion of risk exists based on clear evidence of bioeffects at environmentally relevant levels, which, with prolonged exposures may reasonably be presumed to result in health impacts. Regarding ELF a new lower public safety limit for habitable space adjacent to all new or upgraded power lines and for all other new constructions should be applied. A new lower limit should also be used for existing habitable space for children and/or women who are pregnant. A precautionary limit should be adopted for outdoor, cumulative RF exposure and for cumulative indoor RF fields with considerably lower limits than existing guidelines, see the BioInitiative Report. The current guidelines for the US and European microwave exposure from mobile phones, for the brain are 1.6 W/Kg and 2 W/Kg, respectively. Since use of mobile phones is associated with an increased risk for brain tumour after 10 years, a new biologically based guideline is warranted. Other health impacts associated with exposure to electromagnetic fields not summarized here may be found in the BioInitiative Report at www.bioinitiative.org.},

abstract = {The present study sought to evaluate possible acute effects on 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6s) excretion, a surrogate for melatonin levels in blood, in volunteers exposed to static magnetic fields with flux densities representative for workers in light metal reduction plants and operators of medical MRI in hospitals. Eleven healthy male volunteers (23-43 years) participated. Urine samples were collected for two consecutive 24 h periods from 22:00 hours day 1 (exposure day) through day 2 (day after exposure) and then for 24 h from 07:00 hours on day 7 (control day). On the day of exposure the subjects slept in the MRI room from 22:00 hours until 07:00 hours next morning, thus receiving a 9 h exposure to the magnetic field (2-7 mT). On the day after exposure and on the control day, they slept at home and otherwise performed their ordinary daily activities. Total daily urine production was collected in four parts: 22:00-07:00 hours, 07:00-11:00 hours, 11:00-18:00 hours, 18:00-22:00 hours, and the volume for each interval was measured and recorded. Samples were transferred to coded bottles and frozen for later RIA analysis of aMT6s. Pairs of values of mean hourly aMT6s excretion, both diurnal and for the four daily intervals, were compared using two-sided Wilcoxon signed ranks test. The day of exposure and the day after exposure were not significantly different from the control day, either for the total diurnal secretion or the interval data. In summary, the study shows no association between a single nocturnal exposure to a static magnetic field of strength 2-7 mT and excretion of aMT6s in urine.

@book{Havas2004,
abstract = {The biological effects of low frequency electric and magnetic fields2 (EMF) have become a topic of considerable scientific scrutiny during the past two decades. The flurry of research in this area has contributed greatly to our understanding of the complex electromagnetic environment to which we are exposed but it has not abated the controversy associated with the harmful effects of electromagnetic fields. If anything it has polarized scientists into two camps, those who think exposure to low frequency electromagnetic fields causes health effects and those who do not. Those who believe there is a causal association are trying to find the mechanism responsible and those who question the concept of causality think this research is a waste of time and money. Controversy is the norm when complex environmental issues with substantial economic and health consequences are scientifically scrutinized. Asbestos, lead, acid rain, tobacco smoke, DDT, PCBs (and more recently estrogen mimics) were all contentious issues and were debated for decades in scientific publications and in the popular press before their health effects and the mechanisms responsible were understood. In some cases the debate was scientifically legitimate, while in others interested parties deliberately confuse the issue to delay legislation (Havas et al 1984). The public, uncomfortable with scientific controversy and unable to determine the legitimacy of a scientific debate, wants a clear answer to the question, "Are low frequency electric and magnetic fields harmful?" As a direct response to public concern three major reports, with multiple contributors with diverse expertise, have been published recently on the health effects of low frequency electric and magnetic fields: one by the U.S. National Research Council (1997), another by the National Institute of Environ. Health Sciences (Portier and Wolfe, 1998), and the most recent, still in draft form, by the California EMF Program (2001). These influential reports attempt to make sense of the many, and sometimes contradictory, documents from different fields of study, related to the health effects of power-line frequency fields. The purpose of the present paper is three-fold: (1) To characterize human exposure to low frequency electromagnetic fields; (2) To identify key biological markers and possible mechanisms linked to EMF exposure; (3) To comment on the concept of scientific consistency and bias. The question "Are low frequency electric and magnetic fields harmful?" is valid and timely. The answer is likely to have far reaching consequences, considering our growing dependence on electric power, computer technology, and wireless communication, and it is likely to be of interest to a large population using, manufacturing, selling, and regulating this technology.},

abstract = {Epidemiological studies have reported associations between exposure to power frequency magnetic fields and increased risk of certain cancer and noncancer illnesses. For childhood leukemia, a doubling of risk has been associated with exposures above 0.3/0.4 microT. Here, we propose that the melatonin hypothesis, in which power frequency magnetic fields suppress the nocturnal production of melatonin in the pineal gland, accounts for the observed increased risk of childhood leukemia. Such melatonin disruption has been shown in animals, especially with exposure to electric and/or rapid on/off magnetic fields. Equivocal evidence has been obtained from controlled laboratory magnetic field exposures of volunteers, although the exposure conditions are generally atypical of neighborhood exposures. In contrast, support for the hypothesis is found in the body of studies showing magnetic field disruption of melatonin in human populations chronically exposed to both electric and magnetic fields associated with electricity distribution. Further support comes from the observation that melatonin is highly protective of oxidative damage to the human haemopoietic system. Aspects of the hypothesis are amenable to further investigation.},

abstract = {Recent epidemiological studies have reported an increased risk of leukemia in adults and children near overhead high voltage powerlines at distances beyond the measured range of the direct electric and magnetic fields. Corona ions are emitted by powerlines, forming a plume that is carried away from the line by the wind. The plume generates highly variable disturbances in the atmospheric electric field of tens to a few hundred V/m on time scales from seconds to minutes. Such disturbances can be seen up to several hundred meters from powerlines. It is hypothesized that these random disturbances result in the disruption of nocturnal melatonin synthesis and related circadian rhythms, in turn leading to increased risk of a number of adverse health effects including leukemia. In support of the hypothesis, it is noted that melatonin is highly protective of oxidative damage to the human hemopoietic system. A review of electric field studies provides evidence that (i) diurnal variation in the natural atmospheric electric field may itself act as a weak Zeitgeber; (ii) melatonin disruption by electric fields occurs in rats; (iii) in humans, disturbances in circadian rhythms have been observed with artificial fields as low at 2.5 V/m. Specific suggestions are made to test the aspects of the hypothesis.},

abstract = {Migratory birds have a light-dependent magnetic compass, the mechanism of which is thought to involve radical pairs formed photochemically in cryptochrome proteins in the retina. Theoretical descriptions of this compass have thus far been unable to account for the high precision with which birds are able to detect the direction of the Earth's magnetic field. Here we use coherent spin dynamics simulations to explore the behavior of realistic models of cryptochrome-based radical pairs. We show that when the spin coherence persists for longer than a few microseconds, the output of the sensor contains a sharp feature, referred to as a spike. The spike arises from avoided crossings of the quantum mechanical spin energy-levels of radicals formed in cryptochromes. Such a feature could deliver a heading precision sufficient to explain the navigational behavior of migratory birds in the wild. Our results (i) afford new insights into radical pair magnetoreception, (ii) suggest ways in which the performance of the compass could have been optimized by evolution, (iii) may provide the beginnings of an explanation for the magnetic disorientation of migratory birds exposed to anthropogenic electromagnetic noise, and (iv) suggest that radical pair magnetoreception may be more of a quantum biology phenomenon than previously realized.},

abstract = {The possible effects of repeated night-time exposure to an extremely low frequency magnetic field (ELF-MF) on melatonin were investigated in nine healthy male subjects aged 23-37 yr. The 16-week experiment consisted of 3 weeks of pre-exposure, 11 weeks of night-time exposure to MF generated from a nonheated electric sheet (ES), and 2 weeks of post-exposure recovery observation. The average MF intensity (rms, mainly 50 Hz AC) on the surface of the sheet was 0.7 muT at the head, 8.3 muT at the waist, and 3.5 muT at the feet of the subject. For each of the urine samples collected 5 times a day on scheduled sampling days, the urinary excretion rate (ng/h) of melatonin was determined, and 24 h rhythms were extracted for each subject and each experimental period (pre-exposure, first half and latter half exposure, and post-exposure periods) by the method of complex cosine curve fitting. Although estimates of the peak height, acrophase, and total daily amount of melatonin were characterized by significant variations among individual subjects, they did not reveal any statistically significant difference between exposure periods and nonexposure periods. Thus, the present study indicates that any profound effect of the MF originating from an ES on nocturnal melatonin production and its circadian rhythm is unlikely.

abstract = {The relation between residential magnetic field exposure from power lines and mortality from neurodegenerative conditions was analyzed among 4.7 million persons of the Swiss National Cohort (linking mortality and census data), covering the period 2000-2005. Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyze the relation of living in the proximity of 220-380 kV power lines and the risk of death from neurodegenerative diseases, with adjustment for a range of potential confounders. Overall, the adjusted hazard ratio for Alzheimer's disease in persons living within 50 m of a 220-380 kV power line was 1.24 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.80, 1.92) compared with persons who lived at a distance of 600 m or more. There was a dose-response relation with respect to years of residence in the immediate vicinity of power lines and Alzheimer's disease: Persons living at least 5 years within 50 m had an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.51 (95\% CI: 0.91, 2.51), increasing to 1.78 (95\% CI: 1.07, 2.96) with at least 10 years and to 2.00 (95\% CI: 1.21, 3.33) with at least 15 years. The pattern was similar for senile dementia. There was little evidence for an increased risk of Amyotroph. Lateral Scler., Parkinson's disease, or Mult. Scler..},

abstract = {Four separate experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of extremely low frequency magnetic field (MF) exposure (60 Hz, 1 mT rms) on urinary 6-sulphatoxymelatonin (aMT6s) levels in Sprague-Dawley rats. In the first experiment, immature male rats maintained under a regular 12 h daily photoperiod (white fluorescent light) were exposed to a 20 h daily MF exposure for 6 weeks. The second experiment was similar to the first, except that the MF exposure was limited to 10 days. In the third experiment, adult male rats acclimated to a combination of continuous dim red light and regular 12 h daily photoperiod (white fluorescent) were subjected to a single 1 h exposure to intermittent MF (1 min on and 1 min off cycles), 2 h before fluorescent lights went off. The fourth experiment was similar to the third, except that the animals received 2 consecutive days of 20 h daily exposure to intermittent MF, beginning 1 h before the fluorescent lights went off each day. In all four experiments, the circadian profile of urinary aMT6s was examined before, during, and after the MF exposure. No significant effect of 1 mT MF on indoleamine metabolism was observed in any of the above experiments. However, in one of the experiments (no. 4), both the control and the MF groups showed a lower aMT6s level during the exposure days, when compared with that of pre- and post-exposure days, suggesting that the existence of possible effects with lower field strengths at the range of stray field cannot be ruled out.},

Adult male rats were exposed to a single nocturnal inversion of the earth's magnetic field in the presence or absence of dim red light. Pineal gland N-acetyltransferase and hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase activities were measured as indices of magnetosensitivity. In animals exposed to dim red light, pineal enzyme activities were inhibited significantly by the magnetic stimulus in comparison to controls (dim red light only). In contrast, the pineal response to a magnetic stimulus was absent in total darkness. These results support the notion that photoreceptor stimulation by dim light is necessary for the perception of weak magnetic fields.},

Electrosensitive marine fish might detect the Earth's field through electromagnetic induction, but direct evidence that induction underlies magnetoreception in such fish has not been obtained. Studies in other animals have provided evidence that is consistent with two other mechanisms: biogenic magnetite and chemical reactions that are modulated by weak magnetic fields. Despite recent advances, however, magnetoreceptors have not been identified with certainty in any animal, and the mode of transduction for the magnetic sense remains unknown.},

Based on questionnaire data on exposure to light-at-night (LAN), and measurement-based MF data, the 60 women were classified to four groups: no MF, no LAN; MF, no LAN; no MF, LAN; MF, LAN. The lowest excretion of 6-OHMS was observed in the group of women who were exposed to both MF and LAN, and the differences between the four groups were significant (P {\textless} .0001). The result is based on low numbers, but supports the hypothesis that daytime occupational exposure to MF enhances the effects of nighttime light exposure on melatonin production.},

Proposed as the source of the light-dependent magnetic compass in migratory birds, the radical pair mechanism is thought to operate in cryptochrome flavoproteins in the retina. Here we demonstrate that the primary magnetic field effect on flavin photoreactions can be amplified chemically by slow radical termination reactions under conditions of continuous photoexcitation. The nature and origin of the amplification are revealed by studies of the intermolecular flavin-tryptophan and flavin-ascorbic acid photocycles and the closely related intramolecular flavin-tryptophan radical pair in cryptochrome. Amplification factors of up to 5.6 were observed for magnetic fields weaker than 1 mT. Substantial chemical amplification could have a significant impact on the viability of a cryptochrome-based magnetic compass sensor.},

The rats were housed in exposure and sham-exposure facilities, which were located in the same room, under a 12:12 light-dark photoperiod (lights on at 06:00 h). The room was constantly illuminated by 4 small, dim red lights ({\textless} 0.07 lux in dark period). Levels of plasma and pineal gland melatonin were determined by radioimmunoassay. A significant decrease of melatonin was observed between the control group and groups exposed to a magnetic field at a flux density in excess of 1 microT during the night time, but no statistical differences were found among the exposed groups. These results indicate that subchronic exposure of albino rats to a 50-Hz rotating magnetic field influences melatonin production and secretion by the pineal gland.},

In addition, prior to the exposure experiment, two cage-control groups were placed in the facility for 6 weeks without activation of the 50-Hz magnetic field generation apparatus. Rats were sacrificed at 12.00 and at 24.00 h for collection of plasma and pineal gland: melatonin was determined by radioimmunoassay. Significant reductions of plasma and pineal gland melatonin contents were observed at 0.02 ??T as compared to the control values, and a further reduction was observed at 1 ??T. As do albino rats, pigmented rats also exhibit melatonin suppression when exposed to time-varying magnetic fields. ?? 1994.},

None of these reports have yet approached the level of clarity and simplicity displayed in experiments with the magnetotactic bacteria, which is the best example of geomagnetic sensitivity in any living organism. Furthermore, claims of magnetic effects on living organisms pervade the literature of biomagnetism, but many have failed subsequent attempts at replication. We need to develop simple and easily replicated experiments for marine and terrestrial animals which can be modified to answer basic questions concerning the psychophysics of any geomagnetic sensory system which might be present. In this paper, we report the first replication of the Walker-Bitterman magnetic anomaly conditioning experiment in honey bees, as well as one of our attempts to slightly alter their basic protocol. We also report our attempts to condition honey bees to magnetic direction in simple maze experiments, and the initial results of a pulse-remagnetization experiment designed to test the ferromagnetic transduction hypothesis. We conclude honey bees are sensitive to the geomagnetic field, that the Signal Process for it is more complex than previously thought, and that a ferromagnetic transducer is compatible with all known behavioral data.},

We evaluated distances to power lines up to 2000 m and included consideration of lower voltages (60–69 kV). Distance measures based on GIS and Google Earth evaluation showed close agreement (Pearson correlation >0.99).

abstract = {An extremely low-frequency magnetic field (ELF-MF) is generated by power lines and household electrical devices. Many studies have suggested an association between chronic ELF-MF exposure and anxiety and/or depression. The mechanism of these effects is assumed to be a stress response induced by ELF-MF exposure. However, this mechanism remains controversial. In the present study, we investigated whether chronic ELF-MF exposure (intensity, 3?mT; total exposure, 200?h) affected emotional behavior and corticosterone synthesis in mice. ELF-MF-treated mice showed a significant increase in total immobility time in a forced swim test and showed latency to enter the light box in a lightdark transition test, compared with sham-treated (control) mice. Corticosterone secretion was significantly high in the ELF-MF-exposed mice; however, no changes were observed in the amount of the adrenocorticotropic hormone and the expression of genes related to stress response. Quantification of the mRNA levels of adrenal corticosteroid synthesis enzymes revealed a significant reduction in Cyp17a1 mRNA in the ELF-MF-exposed mice. Our findings suggest the possibility that high intensity and chronic exposure to ELF-MF induces an increase in corticosterone secretion, along with depression- and/or anxiety-like behavior, without enhancement of the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis.

Each case was matched by year of birth, municipality, and first year of entry into the cohort with two randomly selected controls without cancer. Residential exposure to magnetic fields was calculated as that generated by the lines before diagnosis, and occupational exposure was based on exposure matrix data.

Methods 120,852 men and women aged 55–69 years at time of enrollment in 1986 were followed up (17.3 years) for incident lung, breast and brain cancer, and hemato-lymphoproliferative malignancies. Information on occupational history and potential confounders such as sex, age, smoking, alcohol use, and attained educational level were collected at baseline through a self-administered questionnaire. Occupational ELF-MF exposure was assigned with a job-exposure matrix. Using a case-cohort approach, associations with cancer incidence were analyzed with Cox regression stratified by sex, using three exposure metrics: (1) ever had a job with low or high exposure to ELF-MF versus background, (2) duration of exposure, and (3) cumulative exposure. Results None of the exposure metrics showed an effect on incidence for lung, breast, and brain cancer, nor any of the assessed subtypes in men and women. Of the hemato-lymphoproliferative malignancies in men, ever high exposed to ELF-MF showed a significant association with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) [hazard ratio (HR) 2.15; 95 \% confidence interval (CI) 1.06–4.35] and follicular lymphoma (FL) (HR 2.78; 95 \% CI 1.00–5.77). Cumulative exposure to ELF-MF showed a significant, positive association with FL but not AML among men. Conclusions In this large prospective cohort study, we found some indications of an increased risk of AML and FL among men with occupational ELF-MF exposure. These findings warrant further investigation.},

abstract = {Background: Epidemiological evidence suggests that chronic low-intensity extremely-low-frequency magnetic-field exposure is associated with increased risk of childhood leukaemia; it is not certain the association is causal.
Methods: We report a national case–control study relating childhood cancer risk to the average magnetic field from high-voltage overhead power lines at the child's home address at birth during the year of birth, estimated using National Grid records. From the National Registry of Childhood Tumours, we obtained records of 28 968 children born in England and Wales during 1962–1995 and diagnosed in Britain under age 15. We selected controls from birth registers, matching individually by sex, period of birth, and birth registration district. No participation by cases or controls was required.
Results: The estimated relative risk for each 0.2 $\mu$T increase in magnetic field was 1.14 (95\% confidence interval 0.57 to 2.32) for leukaemia, 0.80 (0.43–1.51) for CNS/brain tumours, and 1.34 (0.84–2.15) for other cancers.
Conclusion: Although not statistically significant, the estimate for childhood leukaemia resembles results of comparable studies. Assuming causality, the estimated attributable risk is below one case per year. Magnetic-field exposure during the year of birth is unlikely to be the whole cause of the association with distance from overhead power lines that we previously reported.},

abstract = {The possible effects of repeated night-time exposure to an extremely low frequency magnetic field (ELF-MF) on melatonin were investigated in nine healthy male subjects aged 23-37 yr. The 16-week experiment consisted of 3 weeks of pre-exposure, 11 weeks of night-time exposure to MF generated from a nonheated electric sheet (ES), and 2 weeks of post-exposure recovery observation. The average MF intensity (rms, mainly 50 Hz AC) on the surface of the sheet was 0.7 muT at the head, 8.3 muT at the waist, and 3.5 muT at the feet of the subject. For each of the urine samples collected 5 times a day on scheduled sampling days, the urinary excretion rate (ng/h) of melatonin was determined, and 24 h rhythms were extracted for each subject and each experimental period (pre-exposure, first half and latter half exposure, and post-exposure periods) by the method of complex cosine curve fitting. Although estimates of the peak height, acrophase, and total daily amount of melatonin were characterized by significant variations among individual subjects, they did not reveal any statistically significant difference between exposure periods and nonexposure periods. Thus, the present study indicates that any profound effect of the MF originating from an ES on nocturnal melatonin production and its circadian rhythm is unlikely.

This EPRI study was designed to supplement a National Cancer Institute study (NCI-BC) of magnetic fields, light-at-night, and the risk of breast cancer. By expanding the exposure assessment of the NCI-BC and collecting data on urine melatonin levels, this project provides new insight into a possible magnetic field-melatonin link. It has been proposed that exposure to 60-Hz (power frequency) magnetic fields may increase the risk of breast cancer by suppressing the normal nocturnal rise in melatonin production in the pineal gland. It remains unknown whether the human pineal gland is reproducibly responsive or sensitive to magnetic field exposure, and whether such exposures could alter elements of the endogenous hormonal environment in women that might be important in the etiology of breast cancer. The objective of this research was to investigate whether exposure to power-frequency magnetic fields and/or light-at-night is associated with levels of the primary urinary melatonin metabolite in women without a history of breast cancer.},

During the nights (2000-0800 h, including sleeping time, 2300-0700 h), blood samples were collected from the subjects at 1 h intervals for determining the levels of plasma hormones (melatonin, growth hormone (GH), cortisol, prolactin) and at 10 min intervals from 2200 to 0200 h for observing the GH surge induced by sleep. Statistical analyses revealed no significant difference between the 2 nights in the profiles of the four hormones, and the result suggested that extremely low frequency (ELF) or intermediate frequency (IF) MF to which humans are exposed residentially has no acute effect on nighttime secretion of hormones, particularly melatonin.},

abstract = {Abstract Background: Biological effects of extra-low-frequency (ELF) magnetic fields (MFs) have lacked a credible mechanism of interaction between MFs and living material. Objectives: To examine the effect of ELF-MFs on Cancer Cells. Methods: Five Cancer Cell lines were exposed to ELF-MFs within the range of 0.025-5 µT, and the cells were examined for karyotype changes after 6 d. Results: All Cancer Cells lines lost chromosomes from MF exposure, with a mostly flat dose-response. Constant MF exposures for three weeks allow a rising return to the baseline, unperturbed karyotypes. From this point, small MF increases or decreases are again capable of inducing karyotype contractions (KCs). Our data suggest that the KCs are caused by MF interference with mitochondria's adenosine triphosphate synthase (ATPS), compensated by the action of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). The effects of MFs are similar to those of the ATPS inhibitor, oligomycin. They are amplified by metformin, an AMPK stimulator, and attenuated by resistin, an AMPK inhibitor. Over environmental MFs, KCs of various Cancer Cell lines show exceptionally wide and flat dose-responses, except for those of erythroleukemia cells, which display a progressive rise from 0.025 to 0.4 µT. Conclusions: The biological effects of MFs are connected to an alteration in the structure of water that impedes the flux of protons in ATPS channels. These results may be environmentally important, in view of the central roles played in Hum. Physiol. by ATPS and AMPK, particularly in their links to diabetes, cancer and longevity.},

abstract = {Although considerable experimental evidence now exists to indicate that low-freque,]cy magnetic fileds influence living cells, the mode of coupling remains a mystery. We propose a radical new model for electromagnetic interactions with cells, one resulting from a cyclotron resonance mechanism attached to ions moving through trans- membrane channels. It is shown that the cyclotron resonance condition on such ions readily leads to a predicted ELF-coupling at geomagnetic levels. This model quantitatively explains the results re- ported by Blackman et al. (1984), identifying the focu\~{} of magnetic interaction in these experiments as K charge carriers. The cyclotron resonance concept is consistent with recent indications showing that many membrane channels have helical configurations. This model is quite testable, can probably be applied to other circulating charge components within the cell and, most important, leads to the feasibility of direct resonant electro- magnetic energy transfer to selected compartments of the cell.},

abstract = {In this study we investigated whether a 60 Hz magnetic field can act at the cellular level to influence the growth of human estrogen-dependent breast Cancer Cells. Our experimental design assessed Cell Prolif. of a human breast Cancer Cell line, MCF-7, in the absence or the presence of melatonin which inhibits growth at a physiological concentration of  10(-9) M. In three experiments. continuous exposure to average sinusoidal 60 Hz magnetic fields of 1.90 +/- 0.01, 2.40 +/- 0.70, and 2.53 +/- 0.50   mG, or simultaneous exposure in matched incubators to average   60 Hz magnetic fields of 10.4 +/- 2.12, 11.95 +/- 2.73, and 11.95 +/- 3.28 mG, respectively, had no effect on Cell Prolif. in the absence of melatonin. When MCF-7 cells were cultured in the presence of 10(-9) M melatonin, an 18{\%} inhibition of growth was observed for cells in a 2.40 +/- 0.70 mG field. This effect was blocked by a 60 Hz magnetic field of 11.95 +/- 2.75 mG. In a second experiment, a 27{\%} inhibition of MCF-7 cell growth was observed for cells in a 2.53 +/- 0.50 mG magnetic field, and this was blocked by a 60 Hz magnetic field of 11.95 +/- 3.28 mG. These results provide the first evidence that ELF frequency magnetic fields can act at the cellular level to enhance breast Cancer Cell Prolif. by blocking melatonin's natural oncostatic action. In addition, there appears to be a dose threshold between 2 and 12 mG. The mechanism(s) of action is unknown and may involve modulation of Signal Transduction events associated with melatonin's regulation of cell growth.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of exposure to extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF EMFs) on the liver function of workers.
METHODS: The workers in a factory were selected as subjects, and the recent physical examination data of these workers were collected. The workers aged 20∼40 years and with more than 2 years' working experience were included for analysis; considering the intensity of electromagnetic field, the workers exposed to less electromagnetic radiation were assigned to exposure I group (n = 123), those exposed to more electromagnetic radiation to exposure II group (n = 229), and those not exposed to electromagnetic radiation to control group (n = 212). There were no significant differences in sex, age, height, and body weight between the three groups (P > 0.05). Physical examination, including measurements of direct bilirubin (DBil), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), $\gamma$-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and albumin, was performed in a health examination center. The intensity of electromagnetic field was measured by EFA-300 power frequency electromagnetic field analyzer, and the intensity of noise by AWA5610D integrating sound level meter.
RESULTS: The intensities of electric field and the magnetic field in exposure II group were significantly higher than those in the exposure I group. The levels of ALT, ALP, AST, GGT and albumin in exposure II group were significantly higher than those in exposure I group and control group. However, the level of direct bilirubin in exposure II group was significantly lower than that in exposure I group and control group.
CONCLUSION: Occupational exposure to ELF EMFs may affect human liver function.},

abstract = {Diverse animals detect the Earth's magnetic field and use it as a cue in orientation and navigation. Most research on magnetoreception has focused on the directional or `compass' information that can be extracted from the Earth's field. Because the field varies predictably across the surface of the globe, however, it also provides a potential source of positional or `map' information, which some animals use to steer themselves along migratory pathways or to navigate toward specific target areas. The use of magnetic positional information has been demonstrated in several diverse animals including sea turtles, spiny lobsters, newts and birds, suggesting that such systems are phylogenetically widespread and can function over a wide range of spatial scales. These `magnetic maps' have not yet been fully characterized. They may be organized in several fundamentally different ways, some of which bear little resemblance to human maps, and they may also be used in conjunction with unconventional navigational strategies.},

Twenty participants (15 female, 5 male, 31-60 years old, mean 45.8 +/- 0.7 years) were invited from the group of EHS patients. Twenty volunteers (15 female, 5 male, 31-59 years old, mean 45.0 +/- 0.7 years) served as a control group. The test protocol consisted of a set of examinations: EEG, visual evoked potentials, electrodermal activity, ECG, and Blood Press.. The total duration of the test was 40 min, divided into two 10 min rest periods and two 10 min periods of mathematical performance. Magnetic field and sham exposures were presented randomly during these periods, resulting in four different conditions: Field-Rest, Sham-Rest, Field-Math, and Sham-Math. The data showed significant main effects of the Group factor (EHS vs. control subjects) on heart rate (F-1,F-80=20.6; P <0.01), heart rate spectrum ratio (F-1,F-80=9.5; P=0.02), and electrodermal activity (F-1,F-76 = 4.2; P = 0.04), whereas EEG characteristics did not differ between groups. The Condition factor (mathematical task vs. relaxed) showed main effects for heart rate (F-1,F-80 = 14.8; P < 0.01), heart rate spectrum ratio (F-1,F-80 = 7.8; P = 0.06), electrodermal activity (F-1,F-76 = 56.8; P < 0.01), and alpha and theta spectral bands of EEG. Magnetic field exposure did not affect autonomous system or electroencephalographic variables of either group. These data do not indicate that EHS patients or control are affected by low-level 60 Hz magnetic field exposure. However, persons reporting EHS differed from the control subjects in baseline values of investigated physiological characteristics. Perhaps EHS patients have a rather distinctive physiological predisposition to sensitivity to physical and psychosocial environmental stressors. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Birds in particular have been intensively studied, but the biophysical mechanisms that underlie the avian magnetic compass are still poorly understood. One proposal, based on magnetically sensitive free radical reactions, is gaining support despite the fact that no chemical reaction In Vitro has been shown to respond to magnetic fields as weak as the Earth’s (\~{}50 $\mu$T) or to be sensitive to the direction of such a field. Here we use spectroscopic observation of a carotenoid–porphyrin–fullerene model system to demonstrate that the lifetime of a photochemically formed radical pair is changed by application of ≤50 $\mu$T magnetic fields, and to measure the anisotropic chemical response that is essential for its operation as a chemical compass sensor. These experiments establish the feasibility of chemical magnetoreception and give insight into the structural and dynamic design features required for optimal detection of the direction of the Earth’s magnetic field.},

It has been proposed that transient radical pairs are formed by photo-induced electron transfer reactions in cryptochrome proteins and that their coherent spin dynamics are influenced by the geomagnetic field leading to changes in the quantum yield of the signaling state of the protein. Despite a variety of supporting evidence, it is still not clear whether cryptochromes have the properties required to respond to magnetic interactions orders of magnitude weaker than the thermal energy, kBT. Here we demonstrate that the kinetics and quantum yields of photo-induced flavin—tryptophan radical pairs in cryptochrome are indeed magnetically sensitive. The mechanistic origin of the magnetic field effect is clarified, its dependence on the strength of the magnetic field measured, and the rates of relevant spin-dependent, spin-independent, and spin-decoherence processes determined. We argue that cryptochrome is fit for purpose as a chemical magnetoreceptor.},

Results: Each subject exhibited statistically significant changes in the EEG during presentation of the MF, as evidenced by increases in percent determinism and percent recurrence, two different measures of deterministic structure in the recorded signal, thereby indicating that the MF had been detected. Conclusions: The 100\% response rate manifested by the study group suggested that the ability to detect low-strength, low-frequency MFs is a common property of the human nervous system.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We sought direct evidence that acute exposure to environmental-strength electromagnetic fields (EMFs) could induce somatic reactions (EMF hypersensitivity).
METHODS: The subject, a female physician self-diagnosed with EMF hypersensitivity, was exposed to an average (over the head) 60-Hz electric field of 300 V/m (comparable with typical environmental-strength EMFs) during controlled provocation and behavioral studies.
RESULTS: In a double-blinded EMF provocation procedure specifically designed to minimize unintentional sensory cues, the subject developed temporal pain, headache, muscle twitching, and skipped heartbeats within 100 s after initiation of EMF exposure (p < .05). The symptoms were caused primarily by field transitions (off-on, on-off) rather than the presence of the field, as assessed by comparing the frequency and severity of the effects of pulsed and continuous fields in relation to sham exposure. The subject had no conscious perception of the field as judged by her inability to report its presence more often than in the sham control.
DISCUSSION: The subject demonstrated statistically reliable somatic reactions in response to exposure to subliminal EMFs under conditions that reasonably excluded a causative role for psychological processes.
CONCLUSION: EMF hypersensitivity can occur as a bona fide environmentally inducible neurological syndrome.},

abstract = {Background
Advances in science and technology of electrical equipment, despite increasing human welfare in everyday life, have increased the number of people exposed to Electro-Magnetic Fields (EMFs). Because of possible adverse effects on the health of exposed individuals, the EMFs have being the center of attention. This study was performed to determine possible correlation between Extremely Low Frequency Electro-Magnetic Fields (ELF EMFs) and sleep quality and Public Health of those working in substation units of a petrochemical complex in southern Iran.

Materials and method
To begin with, magnetic flux density was measured at different parts of a Control Building and two substations in accordance with IEEE std 644–1994. Subsequently, the questionnaires “Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index” (PSQI) and “General Health Quality (GHQ)” were used to investigate relationship between ELF exposure level and sleep quality and Public Health, respectively. Both questionnaires were placed at disposal of a total number of 40 workers at the complex. The filled out questionnaires were analyzed by T-test, Duncan and the Chi-square tests.

Results
The obtained results revealed that 28\% of those in case group suffered from poor health status and 61\% were diagnosed with a sleep disorder., However, all members in control group were in good health condition and only 4.5\% of them had undesirable sleep quality.

Conclusion
In spite of a significant difference between the case and control groups in terms of sleep quality and general health, no significant relationship was found between the exposure level and sleep quality and general health. It is worth noting that the measured EMF values were lower than the standard limits recommended by American Conference of Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH). However, given the uncertainties about the pathogenic effects caused by exposure to ELF EMFs, further epidemiological studies and periodic testing of personnel working in high voltage substations are of utmost importance.},

European robins almost certainly have two magnetodetection senses, one associated with the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve, and one based on light-dependent radical-pair processes in both eyes. The first brain areas processing magnetic information from each of these two senses have been identified. It has been experimentally verified that Earth-strength magnetic fields can affect photo-induced chemical reactions and that these reactions can respond to magnetic field direction. Diagnostic behavioural experiments have provided clues to identify putative magnetoreceptive molecules in the retina. We discuss the implications of these and other recent findings and outline crucial open questions with an emphasis on the light-dependent mechanism.},

In the present experiment subjects were exposed to either no field (sham conditions) or to either 20 nT or 70 nT, 7 Hz, amplitude modulated (mHz range) magnetic fields for 30 min. Quantitative electroencephalographic (QEEG) measurements were completed before, during, and after the field exposures. After about 10 min of exposure theta power over the right parietal region was enhanced for the 20 nT exposure but suppressed for the 70 nT exposure relative to sham field exposures.

In this double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled study, we examined the effects of repeated exposure to a 1-$\mu$T ELF-EMF on BP in 20 humans with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Subjects were randomly assigned to either the ELF-EMF group or the sham group. Subjects in the ELF-EMF group were exposed to an ELF-EMF (6- and 8 Hz, respectively, peak magnetic field 1 $\mu$T, peak electric field 10 V m−1) for at least two 10- to 15-min sessions per week, over a period of 4 weeks. In the sham group, the EMF-generating apparatus was not active. We obtained systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP, respectively) measurements at registration and before and after each ELF-EMF exposure session. Subjects in the ELF-EMF and sham groups had mean ages of 52.8 and 55.1 years, and were exposed to a mean of 9.9 and 9.0 sessions, respectively. There was a significant difference between the ELF-EMF and sham groups with respect to change in SBP value between baseline and the end of the exposure regimen (P=0.02), but not with respect to change in DBP (P=0.21). There were no adverse events other than mild paresthesia of the hands of two subjects in the ELF-EMF group. Our results suggest that repeated exposure to an ELF-EMF has a BP-lowering effect on humans with mild-to-moderate hypertension.},

Here, by combining bioluminescence imaging of Per1-luc and PER2::LUC with multielectrode recording, we show developmental changes in SCN circadian rhythms in Cry1(-/-)/Cry2(-/-) mice. At the tissue level, circadian rhythms are found in neonatal but not in adult SCN, whereas at the cellular level, rhythms are detected in both SCN. Cellular circadian rhythms are synchronized in neonates, but not in adults, indicating a loss of rhythm synchrony in the course of development. Synchronized circadian rhythms in adult Cry1(-/-)/Cry2(-/-) SCN are restored by coculture of neonatal, but not of juvenile, SCN. These findings indicate that CRY1 and CRY2 are necessary for the development of intercellular networks that subserve coherent rhythm expression in adult SCN.},

abstract = {Geomagnetic variations of partly interplanetary origin, with cyclic signatures in human affairs and pathology include the incidence of various diseases, regarding which this study of healthy subjects attempted to determine an underlying mechanism by worldwide archival and physiological monitoring, notably of heart rate variability (HRV). In the past half-century, the possible health and other hazards of natural, solar variability-driven temporal variations in the earth's magnetic field have become a controversial subject in view of the inconsistent results. Some well-documented claims of associations between geomagnetic storms and myocardial infarction or stroke have been rejected by a study based on more comprehensive data analyzed by rigorous methods - covering, however, only part of a solar cycle in only part of a hemisphere. It seems possible that inter-solar cycle and geographic variability, if not geographic differences, may account for discrepancies. Herein, we examine the start of a planetary study on any influence of geomagnetic disturbances that are most pronounced in the auroral oval, on human HRV. The magnetic field variations exhibit complex spectra and include the frequency band between 0.001-10 Hz, which is regarded as ultra-low frequency by physicists. Since the 'ultra-low-frequency' range, like other endpoints used in cardiology, refers to much higher frequencies than the about-yearly changes that are here shown to play a role in environmental-organismic interactions revealed by HRV, the current designations used in cardiology are all placed in quotation marks to indicate the need for possible revision. Whether or not this suggestion has an immediate response, we have pointed to a need for the development of instrumentation and software that renders the assessment of circadian, infradian and even infra-annual (truly low frequency) modulations routinely feasible. HRV was examined on the basis of nearly continuous 7-day records by ECG between December 10, 1998, and November 2, 2000, on 19 clinically healthy subjects, 21 to 54 years of age, in Alta, Norway. A geomagnetic record was obtained from the Aurora[ Observatory of the University of Tromso. First, frequency-domain measures of HRV were compared for each person in 24-hour spans of high geomagnetic disturbance versus quiet conditions. Second, cross-spectra between geomagnetic activity and HRV measures were quantified via the squared coherence spectrum using 7-day time series. A 7.5\% increase in the 24-hour average of heart rate, HR (P = 0.00020) and a decrease in HRV were documented on days of high geomagnetic disturbance. The decrease in HRV was validated statistically for the 'total frequency', 'TF' endpoint (18.6\% decrease, P = 0.00009). The decrease in spectral power was found primarily in the 'circaminutan frequency', 'VLF' (21.9\% decrease, P < 0.000001) in conjunction with the 'minutes-to-hours' component, ultra-low-frequency, 'ULF' (15.5\% decrease, P = 0.00865) and circadecasecundan 'low frequency', 'LF' (14.2\% decrease, P = 0.00187) regions of the spectrum. Power-law scaling of the power spectra did not show any statistically significant difference. It is noteworthy that most of the decrease in HRV, except for the circaminutan (VLF) component, was observed only in the season in which sunshine alternated with darkness (D/L), a finding suggesting a mechanism influenced by the alternation of light and darkness. The hypothesis of a light-dark-influenced magnetoreception was also supported by cross-spectral analysis. Group-averaged coherence at frequencies coincident with the geomagnetic Pc 6 pulsations (with periods ranging from 10 minutes to 5 hours) differed with a statistical significance (P < 0.000001) among the three natural lighting conditions, the association being weaker during L/L or D/D than during D/L. By contrast, no statistically significant differences were found in terms of the circadian and circasemidian frequencies in relation to the alternation of sunshine with darkness or rather circannual rhythm stage. In conclusion, evidence is provided herein that an alteration of HRV is most apparent in the circaminutan ('VLF') region, which is clinically important, because a reduction in its power is a predictor of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease. The circadecasecundan ('LF') component of HRV also decreased in association with geomagnetic disturbance, which may reflect an episodic alteration of arterial pressure related to changes in geomagnetic activity. Lastly, our study suggests the existence of a light-dark-influenced magnetoreception mechanism in humans involving mainly the Pc 6 band of the magnetic field.

A sample of 221 women living near a 735-kV line was compared with 195 women the same age living away from any power lines. Participants provided morning urine samples on 2 consecutive days and wore a magnetic dosimeter for 36 consecutive hours to measure personal magnetic exposure. The indoor electric field was assessed by spot measurements. After adjustment for other factors associated with low melatonin secretion, such as medication use or light exposure, nighttime concentration of 6-OHMS was similar in the two groups. When either 24-hour or sleep-time exposure to magnetic field or electric field measurements was used, no exposure-effect relation was evident. However, the trend of decreasing 6-OHMS concentration with age was more pronounced for women living near the lines, as was a lower 6-OHMS concentration in women with high body mass index. Chronic residential exposure to magnetic fields from high-power lines may accentuate the decrease in melatonin secretion observed in some vulnerable subgroups of the population.},

abstract = {Depression is a family of complex and multifactorial illnesses that are characterized by disruptions in the functioning of a number of physiological, neuroendocrine and behavioral processes. Of these, sleep disturbance and circadian rhythm abnormalities constitute the most prevalent signs of depressive illness. Difficulty in falling asleep, decreases in total sleep time and sleep efficiency, early morning awakenings, and rapid eye movement sleep alterations are all commonly seen in depressed patients. Advances or delays in the phase of circadian rhythms have been documented in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder and patients with seasonal affective disorder (SAD). The disturbances in the amplitude and rhythm of melatonin secretion that occur in patients with depression resemble those seen in subjects with chronobiological disorders. The finding that insomnia and circadian rhythm abnormalities are prominent features in depression suggests that a close link exists between melatonin secretion disturbance and depressed mood. This inference has been further strengthened by the finding that agomelatine, a recently introduced melatonergic agent with a novel mechanism of action, has beneficial effects in patients with MDD, bipolar disorder or SAD. Among agomelatine's characteristics are a rapid onset of action and a pronounced effectiveness for improving sleep efficiency and correcting circadian rhythm abnormalities. Disruptions in melatonin secretion or availability may be the common factor, which underlies depressive disorder and its prominent signs and symptoms such as sleep and circadian rhythm abnormalities.

abstract = {The aim of our study was to examine the effects of 16.7 Hz electromagnetic-field exposure on pineal melatonin production in healthy humans. The study was based on comparing urinary 6-hydroxymelatonin sulfate (6-OHMS) levels of 108 male railway workers between leisure periods and days following the start of service on electrically powered engines (66 engineers) or working beneath transmission lines (42 railway employees such as train attendants and station managers; controls). A repeated measures design was used, i.e., each volunteer served as his own control. The exposure averaged 20 muTesla in the most exposed workers and around 1 muTesla in the least exposed. Apart from magnetic exposure the workers were subject to a shift work schedule with daily advances between 15 min and 1 hr. Melatonin was assessed by sampling urinary 6-OHMS both in the morning and the early evening. Evening 6-OHMS values appeared to be lowered by a factor of 0.81 (95{\%}CI: 0.73-0.90) during work days compared to leisure days among engine drivers, but not in the controls. The lowering was not confined to certain types of shift work such as early, normal, or late shifts. During subsequent leisure periods evening values recovered significantly, mean ratio = 1.27 (95{\%}CI: 1.03-1.56), i.e., the effects appeared to be reversible. In contrast, morning 6-OHMS samples of engineers and controls did not differ much between work and leisure days. There was, however, a tendency for a rebound of morning values in a leisure period following a work period both for engineers and controls. The observed pattern appears to be in line with predictions of the "phase response curve." No evidence for a dose-response relation was found. The results support the hypothesis that 16.7 Hz magnetic fields alter 6-OHMS excretion in humans exposed to magnetic fields. An alternative explanation that cannot be excluded in this study is that the difference between engineers and controls is due to differential exposure to day light at work.},

abstract = {In terrestrial organisms, sensitivity to the Earth's magnetic field is mediated by at least two different magnetoreception mechanisms, one involving biogenic ferromagnetic crystals (magnetite/maghemite) and the second involving a photo-induced biochemical reaction that forms long-lasting, spin-coordinated, radical pair intermediates. In some vertebrate groups (amphibians and birds), both mechanisms are present; a light-dependent mechanism provides a directional sense or ‘compass’, and a non-light-dependent mechanism underlies a geographical-position sense or ‘map’. Evidence that both magnetite- and radical pair-based mechanisms are present in the same organisms raises a number of interesting questions. Why has natural selection produced magnetic sensors utilizing two distinct biophysical mechanisms? And, in particular, why has natural selection produced a compass mechanism based on a light-dependent radical pair mechanism (RPM) when a magnetite-based receptor is well suited to perform this function? Answers to these questions depend, to a large degree, on how the properties of the RPM, viewed from a neuroethological rather than a biophysical perspective, differ from those of a magnetite-based magnetic compass. The RPM is expected to produce a light-dependent, 3-D pattern of response that is axially symmetrical and, in some groups of animals, may be perceived as a pattern of light intensity and/or color superimposed on the visual surroundings. We suggest that the light-dependent magnetic compass may serve not only as a source of directional information but also provide a spherical coordinate system that helps to interface metrics of distance, direction and spatial position.},

abstract = {Electric power transmission lines have become objects of public controversy. Hypotheses have linked neurobehavioral effects to the electric and magnetic fields that these lines produce. The authors conducted a telephone interview survey in November 1987 to assess the prevalence of depressive symptoms and headache in relation to proximity of residence to an alternating-current transmission line in the United States. Proximity to the line, defined as residing on a property abutting the right-of-way or being able to see the towers from one's house or yard, was positively associated with a measure of depressive symptoms. The association was not explained by demographic variables associated with depression or by attitudes about power lines or other environmental issues. The estimated prevalence odds ratio was 2.8 (95\% confidence interval (Cl) 1.6-5.1). The estimate did not change appreciably when the definitions of depressive symptoms or of proximity to the line were altered. Nonmigraine headaches had a weaker association with proximity to the line (odds ratio = 1.5, 95\% Cl 0.76-2.8), and self-reported migraine headaches exhibited no association (odds ratio = 0.99, 95\% Cl 0.29-3.4). Additional studies of psychological and behavioral measures should be conducted in relation to electric and magnetic fields, with a strong emphasis on improved exposure assessment.},

abstract = {Magnetoreception in the animal kingdom has focused primarily on behavioural responses to the static geomagnetic field and the slow changes in its magnitude and direction as animals navigate/migrate. There has been relatively little attention given to the possibility that weak extremely low-frequency magnetic fields (wELFMF) may affect Anim. Behav.. Previously, we showed that changes in nociception under an ambient magnetic field-shielded environment may be a good alternative biological endpoint to orientation measurements for investigations into magnetoreception. Here we show that nociception in mice is altered by a 30 Hz field with a peak amplitude more than 1000 times weaker than the static component of the geomagnetic field. When mice are exposed to an ambient magnetic field-shielded environment 1 h a day for five consecutive days, a strong analgesic (i.e. antinociception) response is induced by day 5. Introduction of a static field with an average magnitude of 44 mu T (spatial variability of +/- 3 mu T) marginally affects this response, whereas introduction of a 30 Hz time-varying field as weak as 33 nT has a strong effect, reducing the analgesic effect by 60 per cent. Such sensitivity is surprisingly high. Any purported detection mechanisms being considered will need to explain effects at such wELFMF.},

These fields are less than the suggested intervention level in the UK of 1.6mT and are similar to those found close to some domestic appliances.
METHOD AND MATERIALS: A randomized three-way cross-over design using a battery of computerized cognitive function tests were used in the presence or absence of a 50Hz or static magnetic field. Sixteen healthy volunteers undertook two training and three test sessions with a 50Hz or static 0.6 mT magnetic field from a set of coils centred on the head.
RESULTS: In response to the 50 Hz field, disruptions of accuracy were seen from an attentional task (the ability to correctly recognize words shown 20min previously and the ability to maintain a string of digits in working memory). There was no similar response to comparable levels of static magnetic field.
CONCLUSIONS: These tests indicated at least temporary deterioration in attention, and working and secondary memory performance while a 50 Hz field is applied. There were no adverse effects on speed from any of the tasks. It was not possible in this study to be sure if these effects were persistent.},

The first phase developed criteria for controlled testing using an environment low in chemical, particulate, and EMF pollution. Monitoring devices were used in an effort to ensure that extraneous EMF would not interfere with the tests. A second phase involved a single-blind challenge of 100 patients who complained of EMF sensitivity to a series of fields ranging from 0 to 5 MHz in frequency, plus 5 blank challenges. Twenty-five patients were found who were sensitive to the fields, but did not react to the blanks. These were compared in the third phase to 25 healthy naive volunteer controls. None of the volunteers reacted to any challenge, active or blank, but 16 of the EMF-sensitive patients (64\%) had positive signs and symptoms scores, plus autonomic nervous system changes. In the fourth phase, the 16 EMF-sensitive patients were rechallenged twice to the frequencies to which they were most sensitive during the previous challenge. The active frequency was found to be positive in 100\% of the challenges, while all of the placebo tests were negative.

abstract = {An increased cancer incidence has been reported in individuals living and/or working in an environment in which they are exposed to higher than normal artificial electromagnetic fields. One of the most uniform changes associated with the exposure of animals to either pulsed static geomagnetic fields or to sinusoidal extremely low frequency magnetic fields has been a reduction in high night-time levels of melatonin. Melatonin is a hormone produced especially at night in the pineal gland, a pea-sized organ near the center of the human brain. The high nocturnal production of melatonin leads to elevated blood melatonin levels at night as well. The exposure of humans or animals to light (visible electromagnetic radiation) at night rapidly depresses pineal melatonin production and blood melatonin levels. Likewise, the exposure of animals to various pulsed static and extremely low frequency magnetic fields also reduces melatonin levels. Melatonin is a potent oncostatic agent and it prevents both the initiation and promotion of cancer. Reduction of melatonin, at night, by any means, increases cells' vulnerability to alteration by carcinogenic agents. Thus, if in fact artificial electromagnetic field exposure increases the incidence of cancer in humans, a plausible mechanism could involve a reduction in melatonin which is the consequence of such exposures.},

It is not known by which biophysical mechanism this magnetoreception is achieved. We investigate the possibility that magnetoreception involves radical-pair processes that are governed by anisotropic hyperfine coupling between (unpaired) electron and nuclear spins. We will show theoretically that fields of geomagnetic field strength and weaker can produce significantly different reaction yields for different alignments of the radical pairs with the magnetic field. As a model for a magnetic sensory organ we propose a system of radical pairs being 1) orientationally ordered in a molecular substrate and 2) exhibiting changes in the reaction yields that affect the visual transduction pathway. We evaluate three-dimensional visual modulation patterns that can arise from the influence of the geomagnetic field on radical-pair systems. The variations of these patterns with orientation and field strength can furnish the magnetic compass ability of birds with the same characteristics as observed in behavioral experiments. We propose that the recently discovered photoreceptor cryptochrome is part of the magnetoreception system and suggest further studies to prove or disprove this hypothesis.},

abstract = {Migratory birds are known to use the geomagnetic field as a source of compass information. There are two competing hypotheses for the primary process underlying the avian magnetic compass, one involving magnetite, the other a magnetically sensitive chemical reaction. Here we show that oscillating magnetic fields disrupt the magnetic orientation behaviour of migratory birds. Robins were disoriented when exposed to a vertically aligned broadband (0.1–10 MHz) or a single-frequency (7-MHz) field in addition to the geomagnetic field. Moreover, in the 7-MHz oscillating field, this effect depended on the angle between the oscillating and the geomagnetic fields. The birds exhibited seasonally appropriate migratory orientation when the oscillating field was parallel to the geomagnetic field, but were disoriented when it was presented at a 24° or 48° angle. These results are consistent with a resonance effect on singlet–triplet transitions and suggest a magnetic compass based on a radical-pair mechanism.},

abstract = {The avian magnetic compass has been well characterized in behavioral tests: it is an “inclination compass” based on the inclination of the field lines rather than on the polarity, and its operation requires short-wavelength light. The “radical pair” model suggests that these properties reflect the use of specialized photopigments in the primary process of magnetoreception; it has recently been supported by experimental evidence indicating a role of magnetically sensitive radical-pair processes in the avian magnetic compass. In a multidisciplinary approach subjecting migratory birds to oscillating fields and using their orientation responses as a criterion for unhindered magnetoreception, we identify key features of the underlying receptor molecules. Our observation of resonance effects at specific frequencies, combined with new theoretical considerations and calculations, indicate that birds use a radical pair with special properties that is optimally designed as a receptor in a biological compass.

A published method for digesting freshly obtained pineal glands to the single cell level was modified, yielding better than 95{\%} viability. An In Vitro exposure facility developed for the Food and Drug Administration was used for 12-h overnight exposures of primary pinealocyte cultures to 0.05 mT, 60 Hz, vertical AC and 0.06 mT, DC fields. After exposure, cells were separated from the supernatant by centrifugation. Supernatant melatonin was measured by ELISA assays. Data from 10 experiments demonstrated an average 46{\%} reduction in norepinephrine-induced production of melatonin in the pinealocytes. The results support the hypothesis that EM exposure can produce pineal gland melatonin suppression by affecting individual cells.},

abstract = {AIMS: To investigate the relationship between extremely low frequency magnetic field (ELF-MF) exposure and mortality from leukaemia and brain tumour in a cohort of Swiss railway workers.
METHODS: 20,141 Swiss railway employees with 464,129 person-years of follow-up between 1972 and 2002 were studied. Mortality rates for leukaemia and brain tumour of highly exposed train drivers (21 muT average annual exposure) were compared with medium and low exposed occupational groups (i.e. station masters with an average exposure of 1 muT). In addition, individual cumulative exposure was calculated from on-site measurements and modelling of past exposures.
RESULTS: The hazard ratio (HR) for leukaemia mortality of train drivers was 1.43 (95\% CI 0.74 to 2.77) compared with station masters. For myeloid leukaemia the HR of train drivers was 4.74 (95\% CI 1.04 to 21.60) and for Hodgkin's disease 3.29 (95\% CI 0.69 to 15.63). Lymphoid leukaemia, non-Hodgkin's disease and brain tumour mortality were not associated with magnetic field exposure. Concordant results were obtained from analyses based on individual cumulative exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: Some evidence of an exposure-response association was found for myeloid leukaemia and Hodgkin's disease, but not for other haematopoietic and lymphatic malignancies and brain tumours.},

abstract = {It is well documented that extremely low frequency magnetic field (ELF MF) produced effects on the function of nervous system in humans and Lab. Anim.. Dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways have been implicated in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Recently involvement of Nitric Oxide (NO) in OCD-like behavior is suggested. Hence, the present study was carried out to understand the involvement of dopamine, serotonin and NO in ELF MF induced OCD-like behavior. Swiss albino mice were exposed to ELF MF (50 Hz, 10 G) for 8 h/day for 7, 30, 60, 90 and 120 days by subjecting them to Helmholtz coils. OCD-like behavior was assessed in terms of marble burying behavior (MBB) test. Results revealed that ELF MF induced time dependant MBB, on 7th, 30th, 60th, 90th, and 120th exposure day.

Further, levels of dopamine, serotonin and NO after 120 days of ELF MF exposure were determined in the regions of the brain. The neurohumoral studies revealed that exposure to ELF MF increased NO levels in cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus, and levels of dopamine and serotonin remain unaffected. As OCD-like behavior after ELF MF exposure was associated with higher levels of NO with no significant change in serotonin and dopamine. The effect of such exposure was studied in groups concurrently treated with NO modulators, NO precursor, l-ARG (400 mg/kg) or NOS inhibitor, l-NAME (15.0 mg/kg) or 7-NI (10.0 mg/kg). These treatments revealed that NO precursor exacerbated and NOS inhibitors attenuated ELF MF induced OCD-like behavior with corresponding changes in the levels of NO.},

abstract = {Purpose: The major areas of research that have characterised investigation of the impact of extremely low frequency (ELF) electromagnetic fields on living systems in the past 50 years are discussed. In particular, selected studies examining the role of these fields in cancer, their effects on immune and nerve cells, and the positive influence of these ELF fields on bone and nerve cells, wound healing and ischemia/reperfusion injury are explored. Conclusions: The literature indicates that there is still no general agreement on the exact biological detrimental effects of ELF fields, on the physical mechanisms that may be behind these effects or on the extent to which these effects may be harmful to humans. Nonetheless, the majority of the invitro experimental results indicate that ELF fields induce numerous types of changes in cells. Whether or not the perturbations observed at the cellular level can be directly extrapolated to negative effects in humans is still unknown. However, the myriad of effects that ELF fields have on biological systems should not be ignored when evaluating risk to humans from these fields and, consequently, in passing appropriate legislation to safeguard both the general public and professionally-exposed workers. With regard to the positive effects of these fields, the possibility of testing further their efficacy in therapeutic protocols should also not be overlooked.},

abstract = {Nociception has been reported to be influenced by exposure to magnetic fields (MFs). The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 2 h exposure to weak, oscillating MFs on pain perception thresholds and on pain-related somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs). In 11 healthy volunteers, pain perception thresholds and pain-related SEPs were assessed by intracutaneous electrical stimulation. After sham treatment, pain thresholds significantly increased, whereas after MFs a slight non-significant decrease in thresholds was found. After both treatments pain-related SEP amplitude was reduced, but this decrease was more evident and statistically significant only after MF exposure. The increase found in thresholds after sham exposure may be due to stress-induced analgesia (SIA) and the contrasting behaviour recorded after MF exposure might indicate a suppression of SIA. The significant reduction in pain-related SEP amplitude observed after MF exposure provides the first evidence that human SEPs are influenced by MFs. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {An increasing number of persons with health symptoms of unclear origin take refuge in the hypothesis that they suffer from electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS). So far EHS is not an accepted diagnosis and there is no validated test to verify the proposed relationship between electromagnetic fields and symptoms. Groups reporting EHS are very heterogeneous but share a belief that they have an increased sensitivity to electromagnetic fields. It was studied to which extent a quantitative indicator for electrosensitivity, the electric current perception threshold, and its variability coefficient, depend on the recruitment strategy for self-declared hypersensitive persons. Individual electrosensitivity was investigated by provocation of the lower arms to directly coupled 50 Hz electric currents. Self-declared EHS persons were selected from members of a self aid group, from responders to a newspaper call, and from persons actively asking for investigations in their search for help. It turned out that quantitative electrosensitivity was quite different among the three groups. It is interesting that the members of the EHS self aid group exhibit a considerable overlap with general population sample. Pooled together it could be shown that hypersensitive persons as a group differ significantly from the general population sample, however with a pronounced overlap with the normal range. It can be concluded that EHS groups are very inhomogeneous and contain numerous persons with no increased ability to perceive low frequency electric or magnetic fields. This investigation shows the importance of the study design, in particular of the recruitment strategies of EHS persons for the final outcome.},

Recent pooled analysis confirm results from previous studies, namely an approximately two-fold risk increase at ELF-MF exposures ≥0.4 $\mu$T, and demonstrate consistency of studies across countries, with different design, different methods of exposure assessment, and different systems of power transmission and distribution. On the other hand, recent pooled analyses for childhood brain tumour show little evidence for an association with ELF-MF, also at exposures ≥0.4 $\mu$T. Overall, the assessment that ELF-MF are a possible carcinogen and may cause childhood leukaemia remains valid. Ongoing research activities, mainly experimental and few new epidemiological studies, hopefully provide additional insight to bring clarity to a research area that has remained inconclusive.},

abstract = {It has been hypothesized that nighttime bedroom measurements of extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF EMF) may represent a more accurate reflection of exposure and have greater biologic relevance than previously used 24-/48-hour measurements. Accordingly, the authors extended a pooled analysis of case-control studies on ELF EMF exposure and risk of childhood leukemia to examine nighttime residential exposures. Data from four countries (Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States) were included in the analysis, comprising 1,842 children diagnosed with leukemia and 3,099 controls (diagnosis dates ranged from 1988 to 1996). The odds ratios for nighttime ELF EMF exposure for categories of 0.1-<0.2 mu T, 0.2-<0.4 mu T, and >0.4 mu T as compared with <0.1 mu T were 1.11 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.91,1.36),1.37 (95\% CI: 0.99,1.90), and 1.93 (95\% CI: 1.11, 3.35), respectively. The fact that these estimates were similar to those derived using 24-/48-hour geometric mean values (odds ratios of 1.09, 1.20, and 1.98, respectively) indicates that the nighttime component cannot, on its own, account for the pattern observed. These results do not support the hypotheses that nighttime measures are more appropriate; hence, the observed association between ELF EMF and childhood leukemia still lacks a plausible explanation.},

abstract = {Exposure to extremely low-frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MF) was evaluated in an International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monographs as "possibly carcinogenic to humans" in 2001, based on increased childhood leukemia risk observed in epidemiological studies. We conducted a hazard assessment using available scientific evidence published before March 2015, with inclusion of new research findings from the Advanced Research on Interaction Mechanisms of electroMagnetic exposures with Organisms for Risk Assessment (ARIMMORA) project. The IARC Monograph evaluation scheme was applied to hazard identification. In ARIMMORA for the first time, a transgenic mouse model was used to mimic the most common childhood leukemia: new pathogenic mechanisms were indicated, but more data are needed to draw definitive conclusions. Although experiments in different animal strains showed exposure-related decreases of CD8+ T-cells, a role in carcinogenesis must be further established. No direct damage of DNA by exposure was observed. Overall in the literature, there is limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity in Exp. Anim., with only weak supporting evidence from mechanistic studies. New exposure data from ARIMMORA confirmed that if the association is nevertheless causal, up to 2{\%} of childhood leukemias in Europe, as previously estimated, may be attributable to ELF-MF. In summary, ARIMMORA concludes that the relationship between ELF-MF and childhood leukemia remains consistent with possible carcinogenicity in humans. While this scientific uncertainty is dissatisfactory for science and Public Health, new mechanistic insight from ARIMMORA experiments points to future research that could provide a step-change in future assessments.

abstract = {Exposure to a 50/60-Hz electromagnetic field can decrease the nocturnal production of melatonin in rodents. Melatonin is considered to be a marker of circadian rhythms, and abnormalities in its secretion are associated with clinical disorders, including fatigue, sleep disruption, mood swings, impaired performance, and depression, which are consequences of desynchronisation. Interestingly, some epidemiological studies have been reported finding most of these clinical disorders in individuals living or working in an environment exposed to electromagnetic fields. This experiment was designed to look for the possible effects of acute exposure (9 hours) to 50-Hz linearly polarized magnetic fields (10 mu T) on the pineal function. Thirty-two young men (20-30 years old) were divided into two groups (control group, i.e., sham-exposed: 16 subjects; exposed group: 16 subjects). All subjects participated in two 24-hour experiments to evaluate the effects of both continuous and intermittent exposure to linearly polarized magnetic fields. They were synchronized with a diurnal activity from 08:00 to 23:00 and nocturnal rest. The experiment lasted two months (mid-February to mid-April). The subjects were exposed to the magnetic fields (generated by three Helmholtz coils per bed) from 23:00 to 08:00, while lying down. Blood samples were collected during each session at 3-hour intervals from 11:00 to 20:00 and hourly from 22:00 to 08:00. Total urine was collected every 3 hours from 08:00 to 23:00 and once during the night, from 23:00 to 08:00. The levels of serum melatonin and its metabolite in urine (6-sulfatoxymelatonin) in exposed men did not differ significantly from those in control (sham-exposed) subjects. This study shows that nocturnal acute exposure to either continuous or intermittent 50-Hz linearly polarized magnetic fields of 10 mu T does not affect melatonin secretion in humans.},

abstract = {In a previous study we have shown that exposure to a 50-Hz sinusoidal magnetic field decreased serum melatonin concentration and pineal enzyme activities in young rats (9 weeks). In the present study we looked for the effect of a magnetic field of 100 mu T on serum melatonin and pineal NAT activity in aged rats and compared them to young rats. We hypothesized that aging may change sensitivity of rats to a magnetic field. Two groups of Wister male rats [aged rats (23 months) and young rats (9 weeks)] were exposed to 50-Hz magnetic fields of 100 mu T for one week (18h/day). The animals were kept under a standard 12:12 light : dark cycle with a temperature of 25 degrees C and a relative humidity of 45 to 50{\%}. Control (sham-exposed) animals were kept in a similar environment but without exposure to a magnetic field. The animals were sacrificed under red dim light. Serum melatonin concentration and pineal N-acetyltransferase (NAT) and hydroxyindole-O-methyltransfetase (HIOMT) activities were studied. Our results showed that sinusoidal magnetic fields altered the production of melatonin (28{\%} decrease; P {\textless}0.05) through an inhibition of pineal NAT activity (52{\%} decrease; P {\textless}0.05) in the young rats whereas no effect was observed in aged ones. On the other hand, when comparing data from control animals between young and aged rats, we observed that serum melatonin level and NAT activity, but not HIOMT activity, decreased in aged rats (decrease by about 38{\%} and 36{\%} respectively). Our data strongly suggest that old rats are insensitive to the magnetic field.},

abstract = {Background: High-voltage overhead power lines (HVOLs) are a source of extremely low-frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MFs), which are classified as possible risk factors for childhood acute leukaemia (AL). The study was carried out to test the hypothesis of an increased AL incidence in children living close to HVOL of 225–400 kV (VHV-HVOL) and 63–150 kV (HV-HVOL).
Methods: The nationwide Geocap study included all the 2779 cases of childhood AL diagnosed in France over 2002–2007 and 30 000 contemporaneous population controls. The addresses at the time of inclusion were geocoded and precisely located around the whole HVOL network.
Results: Increased odds ratios (ORs) were observed for AL occurrence and living within 50 m of a VHV-HVOL (OR=1.7 (0.9–3.6)). In contrast, there was no association with living beyond that distance from a VHV-HVOL or within 50 m of a HV-HVOL.
Conclusion: The present study, free from any participation bias, supports the previous international findings of an increase in AL incidence close to VHV-HVOL. In order to investigate for a potential role of ELF-MF in the results, ELF-MF at the residences close to HVOL are to be estimated, using models based on the annual current loads and local characteristics of the lines.},

 @article{Spiegelhalter2002,
abstract = {We consider the problem of comparing complex hierarchical models in which the number of parameters is not clearly defined. Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure PD for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general PD approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher's information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the 'hat' matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding PD to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.},

abstract = {The increasing exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMFs) has raised concern, as increased exposure may result in an increased risk of childhood leukemia (CL). Besides a short introduction of CL and EMF, our article gives an evaluation of the evidence of a causal relation between EMF and CL by critically appraising the epidemiological and biological evidence. The potential impact is also estimated by the population attributable risk. The etiology of CL is largely unknown, but is probably multifactorial. EMF may be one of the environmental exposures involved. Three pooled analyses of case–control studies showed a 1.4- to 1.7-fold increased CL risk for extremely low-frequency EMF (ELF-EMF) exposure levels above 0.3 $\mu$T. Several biases may have played a role in these studies, but are unlikely to fully explain the increased risk. For effects of radiofrequency ELF evidence is lacking. None of the proposed biological mechanisms by which ELF-EMF might cause CL have been confirmed. The estimated overall population attributable risk was 1.9\%, with the highest estimates in Northern America and Brazil (4.2\% and 4.1\%, respectively). The potential impact of EMF exposure on Public Health is probably limited, although in some countries exposure might be relatively high and thus might have a more substantial impact. We recommend nationwide surveys to gain more insight into the contemporary exposure levels among children. Reducing exposure from power lines near densely populated areas and schools is advised. Future epidemiological studies should focus on limiting bias.},

Recently we demonstrated the effect of an oscillating field. Here we report the existence of a weak influence of the static field on visual sensitivity in man. By comparison with control experiments, if the directions of view line and field vector coincide the perception threshold of a light stimulus is slightly but significantly increased.

In this study, we examine the circadian rhythm of melatonin in 15 men exposed chronically and daily for a period of 1-20 yr, in the workplace and at home, to a 50-Hz magnetic field in search of any cumulative effect from those chronic conditions of exposure. The weekly geometric mean of individual exposures ranged from 0.1 to 2.6 microT.

This work shows that subjects exposed over a long period (up to 20 yr) and on a daily basis to magnetic fields experienced no changes in their plasma melatonin level, their urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin level, or the circadian rhythm of melatonin. Our data strongly suggest that magnetic fields do not have cumulative effects on melatonin secretion in humans and thus clearly rebut the "melatonin hypothesis" that a decrease in plasma melatonin concentration (or a disruption in its secretion) explains the occurrence of clinical disorders or cancers possibly related to magnetic fields.},

abstract = {The consequences of electromagnetic exposure on human health are receiving increasing scientific attention and have become the subject of a vigorous public debate. In the present study we evaluated the elects of magnetic field on pineal function in man and rat. Two groups of Wistar male rats were exposed to 50-Hz magnetic fields of either 1, 10 or 100 muT The first group was exposed for 12 hours and the second for 30 days (18 hours per day). Short-term exposure depressed both pineal NAT activity and nocturnal serum melatonin concentration but only with the highest intensity used (100 muT). Long-term exposure. to a magnetic field significantly depressed the nighttime peak of serum melatonin concentration and pineal NAT activity with 10 and 100 muT Our results show that sinusoidal magnetic fields altered the production of melatonin through an inhibition of pineal NAT activity. Both duration and intensity of exposure played an important role in this effect. In the second step of this study, thirty-two young men (20-30 years old) were divided into two groups (control group, i.e., sham-exposed : 16 subjects; exposed group : 16 subjects). The subjects were exposed to the magnetic field from 23h to 08h (i.e. for 9h) while lying down. In one experiment the exposure was continuous, in the second one, the magnetic field was intermittent. No significant differences were observed between sham-exposed (control) and exposed men for serum melatonin and 6-sulfatoxymelatonin. In our last and more recent study, we looked for the circadian rhythm of melatonin in 15 men exposed chronically and daily for a period of 1-20 years, in the workplace and at home, to a 50 Hz (exposure 0.1 to > 0.3 muT) magnetic field. The results are compared to those for 15 unexposed men who served as controls. Blood samples were taken hourly from 2000 to 0800. Nighttime urine was also collected and analyzed. This work shows that subjects exposed over a long period (up to 20 years) and on a daily basis to magnetic fields experienced no changes in their plasma melatonin level, their urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin level, or the circadian rhythm of melatonin.

This has resulted in the classification of ELF-EMF into category 2B, ie, agents that are “possibly carcinogenic to humans” by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Since melatonin, a neurohormone secreted by the pineal gland, has been shown to possess oncostatic properties, a “melatonin hypothesis” has been raised, stating that exposure to EMF might decrease melatonin production and therefore might promote the development of breast cancer in humans. Data from the literature reviewed here are contradictory. In addition, we have demonstrated a lack of effect of ELF-EMF on melatonin secretion in humans exposed to EMF (up to 20 years' exposure) which rebuts the melatonin hypothesis. Currently, the debate concerns the effects of ELF-EMF on the risk of childhood leukemia in children chronically exposed to more than 0.4 $\mu$T. Further research is thus needed to obtain more definite answers regarding the potential deleterious effects of ELF-EMF.},

Here we describe results from the first study in which circularly polarised 50 Hz MF have been administered to isolated pineals in highly controlled conditions. Melatonin release from isolated Wistar rat pineal glands, dissected 2 h after light onset ZT 2, was measured in a flow through culture system, during and after exposure to a 4 h MF similar in nature and magnitude to that produced in extremely close proximity to a high voltage power line (500 micro T 50 Hz circularly polarised). Melatonin release from isolated pineals was comparable to that observed in previous studies, plateauing to approximately 100 pg/ml/30 min. No significant alterations in pineal melatonin release were caused by exposure to the MF when compared to sham exposure ({\textless} 1 micro T). These results suggest that if the circadian system is acutely responsive to MF exposure of this nature, an intact circadian axis may be necessary in order to observe an effect on the production on melatonin from the pineal gland},

The cases were diagnosed from 1965 to 1989 and were matched to controls by year of birth, sex, and municipality, Exposure to electric and magnetic fields was calculated by means of computer programs in which power line characteristics and distance were taken into account. No association was found between exposure to time-weighted average exposure to magnetic fields and cancer at all sites, brain tumors, lymphoma, or leukemia. Cancer at other sites showed elevated odds ratios in the two highest exposure categories in some, but not ail, measures of exposure.

abstract = {There is strong evidence that pineal melatonin is involved in controlling neoplastic processes. We have reported that physiological, but not pharmacological or sub physiological, concentrations of melatonin enhance intercellular communication in normal C3H/10T1/2 fibroblasts. Gap junctional intercellular communication intervenes in the control of Cell Prolif. and differentiation, and seems to play a crucial role in suppression of tumor promotion. A number of In Vivo studies have shown that extremely low frequency (ELF) magnetic fields (MF) can act as cancer promoters or co-promoters. In Vitro, 60 Hz MF have been reported to block melatonin-induced inhibition of Cell Prolif. in human breast Cancer Cells. The mechanisms responsible for the observed interactions of MF at the cellular level remain unknown. In the present study melatonin was added to confluent fibroblasts at a concentration of 10−10 M. Twenty-seven hours later, a fluorescent dye was scrapeloaded into groups of cells and the transfer of the dye to adjacent cells through gap junctions was quantified. Under these conditions melatonin induced a significant increase of dye transfer; this increase was not observed when the cultures were exposed to the MF for 30 min before the scrape-load assay was performed. This finding reinforces previously reported results suggesting that the In Vivo oncostatic action of melatonin could be exerted, in part, through modulation of the levels of gap junctional intercellular communication. Also, the data indicate that ELF-MF could counteract the melatonin-induced enhancement of junctional transfer.},

One of several honeybee senses that is both exceptional and intriguing is magnetoreception – the ability to perceive the omnipresent magnetic field (MF) of the Earth. The mechanism by which animals sense MFs has remained fascinating as well as elusive because of the intricacies involved, which makes it one of the grand challenges for neural and sensory biology. However, investigations in recent years have brought substantial progress to our understanding of how such magneto-receptor(s) may work. Some terrestrial animals (birds) are reported to be equipped even with a dual perception system: one based on diminutive magnetic particles – in line with the original model which has also always been hypothesized for bees – and the other one, as the more recent model describes, based on a sensitivity of some photochemical reactions to MF (radical-pair or chemical mechanism). The latter model postulates a close link to vision and supposes that the animals can see the position of the geomagnetic North as a visible pattern superimposed on the picture of the environment. In recent years, a growing body of evidence has shown that radical-pair magnetoreception might also be used by insects. It is realistic to expect that such evidence will inspire a re-examination and extension or confirmation of established views on the honeybee magnetic-compass mechanism. However, the problem of bee magnetoreception will not be solved at the moment that a receptor is discovered. On the contrary, the meaning of magnetoreception in insect life and its involvement in the orchestration of other senses is yet to be fully understood. The crucial question to be addressed in the near future is whether the compass abilities of the honeybee could suffer from radio frequency (RF) smog accompanying modern civilization and whether the fitness of this dominant pollinator might be affected by RF fields. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of the path that the behavioral research on honeybee magnetoreception has taken and to discuss it in the context of contemporary data obtained on other insects.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine mortality from suicide in relation to estimated exposure to extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields in a cohort of 138,905 male electric utility workers.
METHODS: Case-control sampling, which included 536 deaths from suicide and 5, 348 eligible controls. Exposure was classified based on work in the most common jobs with increased exposure to magnetic fields and indices of cumulative exposure to magnetic fields based on a measurement survey.
RESULTS: Suicide mortality was increased relative to work in exposed jobs and with indices of exposure to magnetic fields. Increased odds ratios (ORs) were found for years of employment as an electrician (OR, 2.18; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.25-3.80) or line worker (OR, 1.59; 95\% CI, 1.18-2.14), whereas a decreased OR was found for power plant operators (OR, 0.67; 95\% CI, 0.33-1.40). A dose-response gradient with exposure to magnetic fields was found for exposure in the previous year, with a mortality OR of 1.70 (95\% CI, 1.00-2.90) in the highest exposure category. Stronger associations, with ORs in the range of 2.12 to 3.62, were found for men younger than 50 years.
CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence for an association between occupational electromagnetic fields and suicide that warrants further evaluation. A plausible mechanism related to melatonin and depression provides a direction for additional laboratory research and epidemiologic evaluation.},

abstract = {Many biochemical, physiological and behavioural processes show circadian rhythms which are generated by an internal time-keeping mechanism referred to as the biological clock. According to rapidly developing models, the core oscillator driving this clock is composed of an autoregulatory transcription-(post) translation-based feedback loop involving a set of 'dock' genes. Molecular clocks do not oscillate with an exact 24-hour rhythmicity but are entrained to solar day/night rhythms by light. The mammalian proteins Cryl and Cry2, which are members of the family of plant blue-light receptors (cryptochromes) and photolyases, have been proposed as candidate light receptors for photoentrainment of the biological clock. Here we show that mice lacking the Cryl or Cry2 protein display accelerated and delayed free-running periodicity of locomotor activity, respectively. Strikingly, in the absence of both proteins, an instantaneous and complete loss of free-running rhythmicity is observed. This suggests that, in addition to a possible photoreceptor and antagonistic clock-adjusting function, both proteins are essential for the maintenance of circadian rhythmicity.},

No valid mechanism, however, has been proposed for an interaction between PF-MF and biological tissues and living beings at intensities relevant to animal and human exposure. Here we proposed to consider PF-MF as disrupters of the natural magnetic signal. Under exposure to these fields, an oscillating field exists that results from the vectorial summation of both the PF-MF and the geomagnetic field. At a PF-MF intensity (rms) of 0.5 mu T, the peak-to-peak amplitude of the axis and/or intensity variations of this resulting field exceeds the related discrimination threshold of magnetoreception (MR) in migrating animals. From our evaluation of the 50/60 Hz responsiveness of the putative mechanisms of MR, single domain particles (Kirschvink's model) appear unable to transduce that oscillating signal. On the contrary, radical pair reactions are able to, as well as interacting multidomain iron mineral platelets and clusters of superparamagnetic particles (Fleissner/Solov'yov's model). It is, however, not yet known whether the reception of 50/60 Hz oscillations of the natural magnetic signal might be of consequence or not. Bioelectromagnetics 31:371-379, 2010. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss.

In rodents, however, a few consistent effects of weak PF-MF have been reported. These are, notably, influence on spatial memory and partial inhibition of melatonin secretion under long-lasting exposure. Recent developments in study of magnetoreception in mammals justify reviving the hypothesis previously proposed of the intervention of the magnetic sense in melatonin disruption by PF-MF. We revisit this hypothesis and revise and extend it with respect to current knowledge and, particularly, with respect to reported effects on spatial memory. Proposals are made for experimental testing of the hypothesis. We argue that these tests may provide further insight into mechanisms of biological interactions of PF-MF and also, into mechanisms of magnetoreception per se. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The so-called Melatonin Hypothesis proposed that decreased nocturnal production of melatonin (MLT) might explain the increased risk of breast cancer that has been formerly attributed to extremely low-frequency (ELF) magnetic fields (MF) of weak intensity. Although the risk of ELF MF upon breast cancer was later dismissed, repeated reports were published of partial inhibition of MLT secretion in rats under long-term (>= 4 weeks) exposure to weak ELF MF. Since 2004, however, this topic has not been experimentally studied any more. In the present study, we propose to go back to the MLT hypothesis and apply it to childhood leukemia, for which an increased risk has been robustly associated with residential exposure to ELF MF. Contrary to the original hypothesis, however, we do not consider decreased MLT levels, but disruption of circadian rhythmicity per se as the effector mechanism. Indeed, the role of the circadian timing system in the development of childhood leukemia has been well established. Motivation for going back to the MLT hypothesis comes from recent data that suggest magnetosensory disruption by ELF MF in mammals, and magnetosensitivity in humans, together with current evidence for an influence on circadian rhythmicity from disruption of non-photic sensory stimuli of various natures. We thus suggest further study on circadian rhythmicity in humans (children if possible) under long-term exposure to weak ELF MF. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {It has been suggested that weak 50/60 Hz [extremely low frequency (ELF)] magnetic fields (MF) could affect circadian biorhythms by disrupting the clock function of cryptochromes (the "cryptochrome hypothesis," currently under study). That hypothesis is based on the premise that weak (Earth strength) static magnetic fields affect the redox balance of cryptochromes, thus possibly their signaling state as well. An appropriate method for testing this postulate could be real time or short-term study of the circadian clock function of retinal cryptochromes under exposure to the static field intensities that elicit the largest redox changes (maximal "low field" and "high field" effects, respectively) compared to zero field. Positive results might encourage further study of the cryptochrome hypothesis itself. However, they would indicate the need for performing a similar study, this time comparing the effects of only slight intensity changes (low field range) in order to explore the possible role of the proximity of metal structures and furniture as a confounder under the cryptochrome hypothesis.},

abstract = {Biological effects of static magnetic fields (MF) and time-varying MF of electricity (50/60 Hz) appear possible $\backslash$r$\backslash$nfrom intensities in the low millitesla range. However, prolonged exposure to 50/60 Hz MF is associated with an increased risk of childhood leukemia at less than one microtesla of time-averaged intensity. And such kind of association is suggested in adults for some blood cancers and senile dementia. The cryptochrome hypothesis has been proposed to explain the $\backslash$r$\backslash$nassociation established with childhood leukemia. Cryptochromes indeed assume the regulation of circadian biorhythms – a disruption of these lasts takes part to carcinogenesis – and they could be intrinsically sensitive to MF as from the low microtesla range. The cryptochrome hypothesis is now supported by diverse experimental observations. And recently, its $\backslash$r$\backslash$nrelevance is further enhanced by the perspective of possible photo-dependence of the clock function of Cry 2 in retina, at least in diurnal mammals – the magnetic sensitivity of cryptochromes is indeed photo-dependent. Such a perspective however implies some major paradigm shifts in the experimental study of biological effects of 50/60 Hz MF as it has been $\backslash$r$\backslash$nconducted to date. On the other hand, the cryptochrome hypothesis can in principle also apply to static MF. For these, indeed, a mechanism of interaction with cryptochromes is identified, which is not the case of 50/60 Hz MF so far. A hypothesis is proposed here for these last, namely, resonance-based interaction with the spin polarization of one or both the radicals of the long-lived (milliseconds) pair FAD•-Trp4•.},

Subjects-383 700 people who Lived during 1970-89 within 500 metres of overhead power lines of 110-400 kV in a magnetic field calculated to be greater than or equal to 0.01 mu T. Study subjects were identified by record linkages of nationwide registers. Main outcome measures-Numbers of observed and expected cases of cancer, standardised incidence ratios, and incidence rate ratios adjusted for sex, age, calendar year, and social class-for example, by continuous cumulative exposure per 1 mu T year-with 95\% confidence intervals from multiplicative models for all cancers combined and 21 selected types. Results-Altogether 8415 cases of cancer were observed (standardised incidence ratio 0.98; 95\% confidence interval 0.96 to 1.00) in adults. All incidence rate ratios for both sexes combined were non-significant and between 0.91 and 1.11. Significant excesses were observed in multiple myeloma in men (incidence rate ratio 1.22) and in colon cancer in women (1.16). Conclusions-Typical residential magnetic fields generated by high voltage power lines do not seem to be related to the risk of overall cancer in adults. The previously suggested associations between extremely low frequency magnetic fields and tumours of the nervous system, lymphoma, and leukaemia in adults and breast cancer in women were not confirmed.},

abstract = {Our lack of knowledge about the biological mechanisms of 50 Hz magnetic fields makes it hard to improve exposure assessment. To provide better information about these exposure measures, we use multidimensional analysis techniques to examine the relations between different exposure metrics for a group of subjects. We used a combination of a two stage Principal Component Analysis (PCA) followed by an ascending hierarchical classification (AHC) to identify a set of measures that would capture the characteristics of the total exposure. This analysis gives an indication of the aspects of the exposure that are important to capture to get a complete picture of the magnetic field environment. We calculated 44 metrics of exposure measures from 16 exposed EDF employees and 15 control subjects, containing approximately 20000 recordings of magnetic field measurements, taken every 30 s for 7 days with an EMDEX II dosimeter. These metrics included parameters used routinely or occasionally and some that were new. To eliminate those that expressed the least variability and that were most highly correlated to one another, we began with an initial Principal Component Analysis (PCA). A second PCA of the remaining 12 metrics enabled us to identify from the foreground 82.7\% of the variance: the first component (62.0\%) was characterized by central tendency metrics, and the second (20.7\%) by dispersion characteristics. We were able to use AHC to divide the entire sample (of individuals) into four groups according to the axes that emerged from the PCA. Finally, discriminant analysis tested the discriminant power of the variables in the exposed/control classification as well as those from the AHC classification. The first showed that two subjects had been incorrectly classified, while no classification error was observed in the second. This exploratory study underscores the need to improve exposure measures by using at least two dimensions: intensity and dispersion. It also indicates the usefulness of constructing a typology of magnetic field exposures. Bioelectromagnetics 26:266–274, 2005. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Cryptochromes are conserved flavoprotein receptors found throughout the biological kingdom with diversified roles in plant development and entrainment of the circadian clock in animals. Light perception is proposed to occur through flavin radical formation that correlates with biological activity In Vivo in both plants and Drosophila. By contrast, mammalian (Type II) cryptochromes regulate the circadian clock independently of light, raising the fundamental question of whether mammalian cryptochromes have evolved entirely distinct signaling mechanisms. Here we show by developmental and transcriptome analysis that Homo sapiens cryptochrome--1 (HsCRY1) confers biological activity in transgenic expressing Drosophila in darkness, that can in some cases be further stimulated by light. In contrast to all other cryptochromes, purified recombinant HsCRY1 protein was stably isolated in the anionic radical flavin state, containing only a small proportion of oxidized flavin which could be reduced by illumination. We conclude that animal Type I and Type II cryptochromes may both have signaling mechanisms involving formation of a flavin radical signaling state, and that light independent activity of Type II cryptochromes is a consequence of dark accumulation of this redox form In Vivo rather than of a fundamental difference in signaling mechanism.},

Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparing of predictive errors between two models.

abstract = {In regular statistical models, the leave-one-out cross-validation is asymptotically equivalent to the Akaike information criterion. However, since many learning machines are singular statistical models, the asymptotic behavior of the cross-validation remains unknown. In previous studies, we established the singular learning theory and proposed a widely applicable information criterion, the expectation value of which is asymptotically equal to the average Bayes generalization loss. In the present paper, we theoretically compare the Bayes cross-validation loss and the widely applicable information criterion and prove two theorems. First, the Bayes cross-validation loss is asymptotically equivalent to the widely applicable information criterion as a random variable. Therefore, model selection and hyperparameter optimization using these two values are asymptotically equivalent. Second, the sum of the Bayes generalization error and the Bayes cross-validation error is asymptotically equal to {\$}2\backslashlambda/n{\$}, where {\$}\backslashlambda{\$} is the real log canonical threshold and {\$}n{\$} is the number of training samples. Therefore the relation between the cross-validation error and the generalization error is determined by the algebraic geometrical structure of a learning machine. We also clarify that the deviance information criteria are different from the Bayes cross-validation and the widely applicable information criterion.},

Magnetite responds by physically twisting, or even reorienting the whole organism in the case of some bacteria, but the magnetic dipoles of individual molecules are too small to respond in the same way. Here we assess whether reactions whose rates are affected by the orientation of reactants in magnetic fields could form the basis of a biological compass. We use a general model, incorporating biological components and design criteria, to calculate realistic constraints for such a compass. This model compares a chemical signal produced owing to magnetic field effects with stochastic noise and with changes due to physiological temperature variation. Our analysis shows that a chemically based biological compass is feasible with its size, for any given detection limit, being dependent on the magnetic sensitivity of the rate constant of the chemical reaction.},

abstract = {Summary
A model of magnetoreception [1] proposes that the avian magnetic compass is based on a radical pair mechanism, with photon absorption leading to the formation of radical pairs. Analyzing the predicted light dependency by testing migratory birds under monochromatic lights, we found that the responses of birds change with increasing intensity [2]. The analysis of the orientation of European robins under 502 nm turquoise light revealed two types of responses depending on light intensity: under a quantal flux of 8·1015 quanta m−2 s−1, the birds showed normal migratory orientation in spring as well as in autumn, relying on their inclination compass [3]. Under brighter light of 54·1015 quanta m−2 s−1, however, they showed a “fixed” tendency toward north that did not undergo the seasonal change and proved to be based on magnetic polarity, not involving the inclination compass. When birds were exposed to a weak oscillating field, which specifically interferes with radical pair processes [4], the inclination compass response was disrupted, whereas the response to magnetic polarity remained unaffected. These findings indicate that the normal inclination compass used for migratory orientation is based on a radical-pair mechanism, whereas the fixed direction represents a novel type of light-dependent orientation based on a mechanism of a different nature.},

abstract = {Birds can use the geomagnetic field for compass orientation. Behavioral experiments, mostly with migrating passerines, revealed three characteristics of the avian magnetic compass: (1) it works spontaneously only in a narrow functional window around the intensity of the ambient magnetic field, but can adapt to other intensities, (2) it is an “inclination compass”, not based on the polarity of the magnetic field, but the axial course of the field lines, and (3) it requires short-wavelength light from UV to 565 nm Green. The Radical Pair-Model of magnetoreception can explain these properties by proposing spin-chemical processes in photopigments as underlying mechanism. Applying radio frequency fields, a diagnostic tool for radical pair processes, supports an involvement of a radical pair mechanism in avian magnetoreception: added to the geomagnetic field, they disrupted orientation, presumably by interfering with the receptive processes. Cryptochromes have been suggested as receptor molecules. Cry1a is found in the eyes of birds, where it is located at the membranes of the disks in the outer segments of the UV-cones in chickens and robins. Immuno-histochemical studies show that it is activated by the wavelengths of light that allow magnetic compass orientation in birds.},

@article{Wood1998,
abstract = {The effects of power-frequency magnetic fields on nighttime plasma melatonin were studied in a group of 30 adult male human subjects. Exposure consisted of 20 mu T (200 mG) at 50 Hz (circularly polarized) at certain times in relation to the predicted time of onset of rise in melatonin concentration for a particular individual (the time of onset was predicted from a previous screening night). Response to this exposure was compared to sham-exposure (in random order). When exposure preceded onset of rise, a significant delay in onset time relative to sham-exposure of approximately half an hour was observed, with indications (marginally significant) of a reduction in maximum melatonin level. Analysis of distribution of time-delays is consistent with two populations: those individuals who respond (around 20\%) and those that do not. Magnetic fields generated by square-wave currents produce more marked reductions in the maximum level when compared to sinusoidal waveforms, but there was no significant difference in onset time.},

abstract = {This review considers the Russian scientific literature on the influence of weak static and of low-frequency alternating magnetic fields on biological systems. The review covers the most interesting works and the main lines of investigation during the period 1900 to the present. Shown here are the historical roots, beginning with the ideas of V. Vernadsky and A. Chizhevsky, which led in the field of Russian biology to an increasing interest in magnetic fields, based on an intimate connection between solar activity and life on the Earth, and which determined the peculiar development of Russian magnetobiology. The variety of studies on the effects of magnetic storms and extremely low-frequency, periodic variations of the geomagnetic field on human beings and animals as well as on social phenomena are described. The diverse experiments involving artificial laboratory magnetic fields acting on different biological entities under different conditions are also considered. A series of theoretical advances are reviewed that have paved the way for a step-by-step understanding of the mechanisms of magnetic field effects on biological systems. The predominantly unfavorable influence of magnetic fields on living beings is shown, but the cases of favorable influence of magnetic fields on human beings and lower animals are demonstrated as well. The majority of Russian investigations in this area of science has been unknown among the non-Russian speaking audience for many reasons, primarily because of a language barrier. Therefore, it is hoped that this review may be of interest to the international scientific community.},

@article{Winklhofer2013,
abstract = {The avian magnetic compass works in a fairly narrow functional window around the intensity of the local geomagnetic field, but adjusts to intensities outside this range when birds experience these new intensities for a certain time. In the past, the geomagnetic field has often been much weaker than at present. To find out whether birds can obtain directional information from a weak magnetic field, we studied spontaneous orientation preferences of migratory robins in a 4 µT field (i.e. a field of less than 10 per cent of the local intensity of 47 µT). Birds can adjust to this low intensity: they turned out to be disoriented under 4 µT after a pre-exposure time of 8 h to 4 µT, but were able to orient in this field after a total exposure time of 17 h. This demonstrates a considerable plasticity of the avian magnetic compass. Orientation in the 4 µT field was not affected by local anaesthesia of the upper beak, but was disrupted by a radiofrequency magnetic field of 1.315 MHz, 480 nT, suggesting that a radical-pair mechanism still provides the directional information in the low magnetic field. This is in agreement with the idea that the avian magnetic compass may have developed already in the Mesozoic in the common ancestor of modern birds.},

@article{Yoshii2009,
abstract = {Since 1960, magnetic fields have been discussed as Zeitgebers for circadian clocks, but the mechanism by which clocks perceive and process magnetic information has remained unknown. Recently, the radical-pair model involving light-activated photoreceptors as magnetic field sensors has gained considerable support, and the blue-light photoreceptor cryptochrome (CRY) has been proposed as a suitable molecule to mediate such magnetosensitivity. Since CRY is expressed in the circadian clock neurons and acts as a critical photoreceptor of Drosophila's clock, we aimed to test the role of CRY in magnetosensitivity of the circadian clock. In response to light, CRY causes slowing of the clock, ultimately leading to arrhythmic behavior. We expected that in the presence of applied magnetic fields, the impact of CRY on clock rhythmicity should be altered. Furthermore, according to the radical-pair hypothesis this response should be dependent on wavelength and on the field strength applied. We tested the effect of applied static magnetic fields on the circadian clock and found that flies exposed to these fields indeed showed enhanced slowing of clock rhythms. This effect was maximal at 300 muT, and reduced at both higher and lower field strengths. Clock response to magnetic fields was present in blue light, but absent under red-light illumination, which does not activate CRY. Furthermore, cry(b) and cry(OUT) mutants did not show any response, and flies overexpressing CRY in the clock neurons exhibited an enhanced response to the field. We conclude that Drosophila's circadian clock is sensitive to magnetic fields and that this sensitivity depends on light activation of CRY and on the applied field strength, consistent with the radical pair mechanism. CRY is widespread throughout biological systems and has been suggested as receptor for magnetic compass orientation in migratory birds. The present data establish the circadian clock of Drosophila as a model system for CRY-dependent magnetic sensitivity. Furthermore, given that CRY occurs in multiple tissues of Drosophila, including those potentially implicated in fly orientation, future studies may yield insights that could be applicable to the magnetic compass of migratory birds and even to potential magnetic field effects in humans.},
